the pages indicated are not valid.</p>

<p class='c001'>The text was printed with two columns per page, which could not be
reproduced in this format.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Please
see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text
for details regarding the handling of any textual issues encountered
during its preparation.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>An American reprint of “<cite>The Reader’s Handbook of allusions, references,
plots and stories, by the Rev. E. Cobham Brewer, LL.D., of Trinity Hall, Cambridge</cite>,”
has been for several years in the hands of cis-Atlantic students.</p>

<p class='c001'>Too much praise cannot be awarded to the erudition and patient diligence
displayed in the compilation of this volume of nearly twelve hundred pages. The
breadth of range contemplated by the learned editor is best indicated in his own
words:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The object of this <cite>Handbook</cite> is to supply readers and speakers with a lucid,
but very brief account of such names as are used in allusions and references,
whether by poets or prose writers;—to furnish those who consult it with the plot
of popular dramas, the story of epic poems, and the outline of well-known tales.
The number of dramatic plots sketched out is many hundreds. Another striking
and interesting feature of the book is the revelation of the source from which
dramatists and romancers have derived their stories, and the strange repetitions of
historic incidents. It has been borne in mind throughout that it is not enough to
state a fact. It must be stated attractively, and the character described must be
drawn characteristically if the reader is to appreciate it, and feel an interest in
what he reads.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All that Dr. Brewer claims for his book is sustained by examination of it.
It is nevertheless true that there is in it a mass of matter comparatively unattractive
to the American student and to the general reader. Many of his “allusions”
are to localities and neighborhood traditions that, however interesting to
English people, seem to us trivial, verbose and inopportune, while he, whose chief
object in the purchase of the work is to possess a popular encyclopædia of literature,
is rather annoyed than edified by even an erudite author when his “talk is
of oxen,” fish, flesh and fowl.</p>

<p class='c001'>Furthermore, the <cite>Handbook</cite> was prepared so long ago that the popular literature
of the last dozen years is unrecorded; writers who now occupy the foremost
places in the public eye not being so much as named.</p>

<p class='c001'>In view of these and other drawbacks to the extended usefulness of the
manual, the publishing-house whose imprint is upon the title-page of the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>work, taking the stanch foundation laid by Dr. Brewer, have caused to be constructed
upon it a work that, while retaining all of the original material that can
interest and aid the English-speaking student, gives also “characters and sketches
found in <em>American</em> novels, poetry and drama.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It goes without saying that in the attempt to do this, it was necessary to
leave out a greater bulk of entertaining matter than could be wrought in upon
the original design. The imagination of the compiler, to whose reverent hands
the task was entrusted, recurred continually, while it was in progress, to the magnificent
hyperbole of the sacred narrator—“The which, if they should be written,
every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that
should be written.” Appreciation of the honor put upon her by the commission
deepened into delight as the work went on—prideful delight in the richness and
variety of our national literature. To do ample justice to every writer and book
would have been impossible, but the leading works of every author of note have
the honorable place. It is hoped that the company of “characters” introduced
among <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dramatis personæ</i></span> of English and foreign classics, ancient and modern, will
enliven pages that are already fascinating. Many names of English authors
omitted from the <cite>Handbook</cite> for the reason stated awhile ago, will also be found in
their proper positions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The compiler and editor of this volume would be ungrateful did she not
express her sense of obligation for assistance received in the work of collecting
lists of writers and books from “<cite>The Library of American Literature</cite>,” prepared by
Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman and Miss Ellen Hutchinson.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides this, and a tolerable degree of personal familiarity with the leading
literature of her own land, her resort has been to the public libraries in New York
City—notably, to <cite>The Astor</cite> and <cite>The Mercantile</cite>. For the uniform courtesy she
has received from those in charge of these institutions she herewith makes
acknowledgement in the publisher’s name and in her own.</p>

<b>Falkland</b>, an aristocratic
gentleman, of a noble, loving
nature, but the victim
of false honor and morbid
refinement of feeling. Under
great provocation, he was
goaded on to commit murder, but being
tried was honorably acquitted, and another
person was executed for the crime. Caleb
Williams, a lad in Falkland’s service, accidently

than his nephew Oscar, and does not appear
on the scene until after Oscar’s death. He
is rash and fiery, eager for military glory,
and brave as a lion. When Fingal appointed
Gaul to command for the day,
Fillan had hoped his father’s choice
might have fallen to his own lot. “On
his spear stood the son of Clatho ...
thrice he raised his eyes to Fingal; his
voice thrice failed him as he spoke ...
He strode away; bent over a distant
stream ... the tear hung in his eye. He
struck at times the thistle’s head with his
inverted spear.” Yet showed he no jealousy,
for when Gaul was in danger, he
risked his own life to save him. Next
day was Fillan’s turn to lead, and his deeds
were unrivalled in dash and brilliancy.
He slew Foldath, the general of the opposing
army, but when Cathmor, “Lord
of Atha,” the commander-in-chief, came
against him, Fillan fell. His modesty was
then as prominent as his bravery. “Lay
me,” he said to Ossian, “in that hollow

<p class='c020'><b>Flash</b> (<i>Captain</i>), a blustering, cowardly

met him paying court to Miss Biddy Bellaw,
he commanded the blustering coward
to “deliver up his sword,” and added:</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Fle´ance,</b> in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, is
the son of Banquo, one of Duncan’s trusted
generals, and beloved and honored by
Macbeth until the witches’ prophecy
promises him the crown for which Macbeth
has murdered the king. Macbeth
resolves to destroy Banquo and his son,
but while the father is murdered the son
escapes, and the death-blow is given to
Macbeth’s hope of an undisputed succession.
Thus far the play; the chronicle
makes Fleance become in time the Lord
High Steward (Stewart, Stuart) of Scotland,
and the ancestor of the House of
Stuart which gave James I. to the English
throne. James was very proud of
this descent from Shakespeare’s Banquo,
whose character was evidently drawn to
flatter the king, since the Banquo of Holinshed’s
Chronicle, from which the main
of the play is drawn, is Macbeth’s partner
in the murder of Duncan.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Florimel</i> (<i>The False</i>), made by a witch of
Riphæ´an snow and virgin wax, with an
infusion of vermilion. Two burning
lamps in silver sockets served for eyes, fine
gold wire for locks, and for soul “a sprite
that had fallen from heaven.” Braggadoccio,
seeing this false Florimel, carried
“her” off as the veritable Florimel; but
when he was stripped of his borrowed
plumes, this waxen Florimel vanished into
thin air, leaving nothing behind except the
“golden girdle that was about her waist.”—Spenser,
<em>Faëry Queen</em>, iii. 8, and v.3
(1590-1596).</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Florimel’s Girdle</b>, a girdle which gave
to those who wore it, “the virtue of chaste
love and wifehood true;” if any woman
not chaste or faithful put it on, it immediately
“loosed or tore asunder.” It was
once the cestus of Venus, but when that
queen of beauty wantoned with Mars, it
fell off and was left on the “Acidalian
mount.”—Spenser, <em>Faëry Queen</em>, iv. 2
(1596).</p>

<p class='c001'>One day Sir Cambel, Sir Triamond, Sir
Paridel, Sir Blandamour, and Sir Ferramont
agreed to give Florimel’s girdle to
the most beautiful lady; when the previous
question was moved, “Who was the
most beautiful?” Of course, each knight,
as in duty bound, adjudged his own lady
to be the paragon of women, till the witch’s
image of snow and wax, made to represent
Florimel, was produced, when all agreed
that it was without a peer, and so the
girdle was handed to “the false Florimel.”
On trying it on, however, it would in no
wise fit her; and when by dint of pains it
was at length fastened, it instantly
loosened and fell to the ground. It would
fit Amoret exactly, and of course Florimel,
but not the witch’s thing of snow and
wax.—Spenser, <em>Faëry Queen</em>, iv. 5 (1596).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Morgan la Fée sent King Arthur a
<em>horn</em>, out of which no lady could drink
“who was not to herself or to her husband
true.” Ariosto’s <em>enchanted cup</em> possessed
a similar spell.</p>

<p class='c001'>A boy showed King Arthur a <em>mantle</em>
which no wife not leal could wear. If any
unchaste wife or maiden put it on, it
would either go to shreds or refuse to
drape decorously.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Ephesus was a <em>grotto</em> containing a
statue of Diana. If a chaste wife or
maiden entered, a reed there (presented by
Pan) gave forth most melodious sounds;
but if the unfaithful or unchaste entered,
the sounds were harsh and discordant.</p>

called over the Moors, who came to Spain
in large numbers and drove Roderick
from the throne. Orpas, the renegade
archbishop of Sev´ille, asked Florinda to
become his bride, but she shuddered at

Her marriage however was deferred,
from the great aversion of the major’s
father to the French, and he went to
Havana. In due time he returned to
England and Colonel Tamper with him.
Now Colonel Tamper was in love with
Emily, and wishing to try the strength of
her affection, pretended to be severely
mutilated in the wars. Florival was a
guest of Emily at the time, and, being apprised
of the trick, resolved to turn the
tables on the colonel, so when he entered
the room as a maimed soldier, he found
there Florival, dressed as an officer, and,
under the name of Captain Johnson, flirting
most desperately with Emily. The
colonel was mad with jealousy, but in the
very whirlwind of his rage, Major Belford
recognized Mdlle. Florival, saw through

then fled from Bohemia, and took refuge

son of seignior Gèronte (2 <i>syl.</i>), who falls
in love with Zerbinette, supposed to be a
gypsy, but in reality the daughter of seignior
Argante (2 <i>syl.</i>), stolen by the gypsies
in early childhood. Her brother Octave
(2 <i>syl.</i>) falls in love with Hyacinthe, whom
he supposes to be Hyacinthe Pandolphe of
Tarentum, but who turns out to be Hyacinthe
Gèronte, the sister of Lèandre.
Now, the gypsies demand £1500 as the
ransom of Zerbinette, and Octave requires
£80 for his marriage with Hyacinthe.
Scapin obtains both these sums from the
fathers under false pretences, and at the

with his head bound as if on the point

you wish for will come into this sack,
if you only say ‘Artchila murtchila!’” (<i>i.e.</i>
“come (<em>or</em> go) into my sack”). Fourteen’s
last achievement was this: He went to
paradise, and being refused admission,
poked his sack through the keyhole of the

himself on the other side of the door, and,

<p class='c020'>⁂ Gabriel is so called “The Messenger

<p class='c020'><i>Gabriel</i> (according to the <cite>Korân</cite> and
Sale’s notes):</p>

<p class='c001'>1. It is from this angel that Mahomet
professes to have received the <cite>Korân</cite>; and
he acts the part of the Holy Ghost in
causing believers to receive the divine
revelation.—Ch. ii.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. It was the angel Gabriel that won
the battle of Bedr. Mahomet’s forces
were 319, and the enemy’s a <em>thousand</em>;
but Gabriel (1) told Mahomet to throw a
handful of dust in the air, and so doing
the eyes of the enemy were “confounded;”
(2) he caused the army of Mahomet to
appear twice as many as the army opposed
to it; (3) he brought from heaven 3000
angels, and, mounted on his horse Haïzûm,
led them against the foe.—Ch. iii.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Gabriel appeared twice to Mahomet
in his angelic form: first “in the highest
part of the horizon,” and next “by the lote
tree,” on the right hand of the throne of
God.—Ch. liv.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. Gabriel’s horse is called Haïzûm, and
when the golden calf was made, a little of
the dust from under this horse’s feet being
thrown into its mouth, the calf began to
low, and received life.—Ch. ii.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Gabriel</i> (according to other legends):</p>

<p class='c001'>The Persians call Gabriel “the angel of
revelations,” because he is so frequently
employed by God to carry His messages
to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Jews call Gabriel their enemy and
the messenger of wrath; but Michael
they call their friend, and the messenger
of all good tidings.</p>

<p class='c001'>In mediæval romance, Gabriel is the
second of the seven spirits which stand
before the throne of God, and he is frequently
employed to carry the prayers of
man to heaven, or bring the messages of
God to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Longfellow, in the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>,
makes Gabriel “the angel of the moon,”
and says that he “brings to man the gift
of hope.”</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Gabriel Lajeunesse</b>, son of Basil the
blacksmith of Grand Pré, in Acadia (now
<i>Nova Scotia</i>). He was legally plighted to
Evangeline, daughter of Benedict Bellefontaine
(the richest farmer of the village);
but next day all the inhabitants were
exiled by order of George II., and their
property confiscated. Gabriel was parted
from his troth-plight wife, and Evangeline
spent her whole life in trying to find
him. After many wanderings, she went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to Philadelphia, and became a sister of
mercy. The plague visited this city, and
in the almshouse the sister saw an old
man stricken down by the pestilence. It
was Gabriel. He tried to whisper her

de Cœuvres, and fell in love with Gabrielle,
then 19 years old. To throw a veil
over his intrigue, he gave her in marriage
to Damerval de Liancourt, created her
duchess of Beaufort, and took her to live
with him at court.</p>

<p class='c001'>The song beginning “Charmante Gabrielle

who adores her dog, and slights her invalid
son. Gabrielle is dutiful to the old countess,
and an angel of mercy to her son, although
for awhile she dislikes and fears
him. Finally, she tells the crippled man:</p>

<p class='c021'>“You are a greater hero in my eyes than if

insult, and Argeo, having apprehended
him, confined him in a dungeon. One
day, Gabrina visited him there, and implored
him to save her from a knight who
sought to dishonor her. Philandre willingly
espoused her cause, and slew the
knight, who proved to be her husband.
Gabrina then told her champion that if he
refused to marry her, she would accuse him
of murder to the magistrates. On this
threat he married her, but ere long was
killed by poison. Gabrina now wandered
about the country as an old hag, and being
fastened on Odori´co, was hung by him

<p class='c020'><b>Gal´ahad</b> (<i>Sir</i>), the chaste son of Sir
Launcelot and the fair Elaine (King Pelles’s
daughter, pt. iii. 2), and thus was fulfilled
a prophecy that she should become
the mother of the noblest knight that was
ever born. Queen Guenevere says that
Sir Launcelot “came of the eighth degree
from our Saviour, and Sir Galahad is of
the ninth ... and, therefore, be they the
greatest gentlemen of all the world” (pt.
iii. 35). His sword was that which Sir
Balin released from the maiden’s scabbard
(see <span class='sc'>Balin</span>), and his shield belonged to
King Euelake [<em>Evelake</em>], who received it
from Joseph of Arimathy. It was a snow-white
shield, on which Joseph had made a
cross with his blood (pt. iii. 39). After
divers adventures, Sir Galahad came to
Sarras, where he was made king, was
shown the sangraal by Joseph of Arimathy,
and <a id='corr57L.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='took'>“took</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_57L.23'><ins class='correction' title='took'>“took</ins></a></span> the Lord’s body between his
hands,” and died. Then suddenly “a great
multitude of angels bear his soul up to
heaven,” and “sithence was never no man
that could say he had seen the sangraal”
(pt. iii. 103).</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Galahad was the only knight who
could sit in the “Siege Perilous,” a seat
in the Round Table reserved for the knight
destined to achieve the quest of the holy
graal, and no other person could sit in it
without peril of his life (pt. iii. 32). He
also drew from the iron and marble rock
the sword which no other knight could release
(pt. iii. 33). His great achievement
was that of the Holy Graal.</p>

sons of Sir Johan di Boundys, who, on
his death-bed, left “five plowes of land”
to each of his two elder sons, and the
residue of his property to the youngest.
The eldest son took charge of Gamelyn,
but treated him shamefully. On one
occasion he said to him, “Stand still,
gadelyng, and hold thy peace.” To which
the proud boy retorted, “I am no gadelyng,
but the lawful son of a lady and
true knight.” On this, the elder brother
sent his servants to chastise him, but he
drove them off “with a pestel.” At a
wrestling match young Gamelyn threw
the champion, and carried off the prize
ram; but on reaching home found the
door closed against him. He at once
kicked the door down, and threw the
porter into a well. The elder brother
now bound the young madcap to a tree,
and left him two days without food; but
Adam the spencer, unloosed him; and
Gamelyn fell upon a party of ecclesiastics,
who had come to dine with his brother,
and “sprinkled holy water on them with
a stout oaken cudgel.” The sheriff sent
to apprehend the young spitfire, but he
fled with Adam into the woods, and
came upon a party of foresters sitting at
meat. The captain gave him welcome,
and Gamelyn in time became “king of
the outlaws.” His brother being sheriff,
would have put him to death, but Gamelyn
hanged his brother on a forest tree.
After this the king appointed him chief
ranger, and he married.—The Coke’s <cite>Tale

supposed composition of John Still, M.A.,
afterwards bishop of Bath and Wells;”
but in 1551 John Still was a boy not nine
years old. The fun of this comedy turns
on the loss and recovery of a <em>needle</em>, with
which Gammer Gurton was repairing the
breeches of her man Hodge. The comedy
contains the famous drinking song, “I

Sarah was noted for her gouty umbrella,
and for her perpetual reference to an
hypothetical Mrs. Harris, whose opinions
were a confirmation of her own. She
was fond of strong tea and strong
stimulants. “Don’t ask me,” she said,
“whether I won’t take none, or whether
I will, but leave the bottle on the chimley
piece, and let me put my lips to it when
I am so dispoged.” When Mrs. Prig
“her pardner,” stretched out her hand

stopped the hand and said with great
feeling, “No, Betsy! drink fair, wotever

“Judas” of Charlemagne’s paladins.
His castle was built on the Blocksberg, the
loftiest peak of the Hartz Mountains.
Charlemagne was always trusting this
base knight, and was as often betrayed by
him. Although the very business of the
paladins was the upholding of Christianity,
Sir Ganelon was constantly intriguing for
its overthrow. No doubt jealousy of Sir
Roland made him a traitor, and he basely
planned with Marsillus (the Moorish king),
the attack of Roncesvallês. The character
of Sir Ganelon was marked with spite, dissimulation,
and intrigue, but he was
patient, obstinate and enduring. He was
six feet and a half in height, had large
glaring eyes and fiery red hair. He loved
solitude, was very taciturn, disbelieved in
the existence of moral good, and has become
a by-word for a false and faithless
friend. Dantê has placed him in his “Inferno.”

hero and title of one of the <cite>Arabian

merchant of Damascus, named Abou
Aibou. On the death of his father he
went to Bagdad, to dispose of the merchandise
left, and accidentally saw three
slaves secretly burying a chest in the
earth. Curiosity induced him to disinter
the chest, when lo! it contained a beautiful
woman, sleeping from the effects of a
narcotic drug. He took her to the lodgings,
and discovered that the victim was
Fetnab, the caliph’s favorite, who had been
buried alive by order of the sultana, out
of jealousy. When the caliph heard thereof,
he was extremely jealous of the young
merchant, and ordered him to be put to
death, but he made good his escape in
the guise of a waiter, and lay concealed
till the angry fit of the caliph had subsided.
When Haroun-al-Raschid (the caliph) came
to himself, and heard the unvarnished
facts of the case, he pardoned Ganem, gave
to him Fetnab for a wife, and appointed
him to a lucrative post about the court.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Gareth</b> (<i>Sir</i>), according to Ancient romance,
was the youngest son of Lot, king
of Orkney and Morgawse, Arthur’s [half]
sister. His mother, to deter him from entering
Arthur’s court, said, jestingly, she
would consent to his so doing if he concealed
his name and went as a scullion for
twelve months. To this he agreed, and
Sir Kay, the king’s steward, nicknamed
him “Beaumains,” because his hands were
unusually large. At the end of the year
he was knighted, and obtained the quest
of Linet, who craved the aid of some
knight to liberate her sister Lionês, who
was held prisoner by Sir Ironside in Castle
Perilous. Linet treated Sir Gareth with
great contumely, calling him a washer of
dishes and a kitchen knave; but he overthrew
the five knights and liberated the
lady, whom he married. The knights
were—first, the Black Knight of the Black
Lands <em>or</em> Sir Pere´ard (2 <i>syl.</i>), the Green
Knight <em>or</em> Sir Pertolope, the Red Knight
<em>or</em> Sir Perimo´nês, the Blue Knight <em>or</em> Sir
Persaunt of India (four brothers), and lastly,
the Red Knight of the Red Lands or
Sir Ironside.—Sir T. Malory, <cite>History of
Prince Arthur</cite>, i. 120-153 (1470).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ According to Tennyson, Sir Gareth
was “the last and tallest son of Lot, king
of Orkney, and of Bellicent his wife.” He
served as kitchen knave in King Arthur’s
hall a twelvemonth and a day, and was
nicknamed “Fair-hands” (<em>Beaumains</em>). At
the end of twelve months he was knighted,
and obtained leave to accompany Lynette
to the liberation of her sister Lyonors,
who was held captive in Castle Perilous
by a knight called Death or Mors. The
passages to the castle were kept by four
brothers, called by Tennyson, Morning
Star <em>or</em> Phos´phorus, Noonday Sun <em>or</em>
Meridies, Evening Star <em>or</em> Hespĕrus, and
Night <em>or</em> Nox, all of whom he overthrew.
At length Death leapt from the cleft skull
of Night, and prayed the knight not to
kill him, seeing that what he did his
brothers had made him do. At starting,
Lynette treated Gareth with great contumely,
but softened to him more and
more after each victory, and at last married
him.</p>

<p class='c020'><cite>Gareth and Linet´</cite> is in reality an allegory,
a sort of Bunyan’s <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>,
describing the warfare of a Christian from
birth to his entrance into glory. The
“Bride” lived in Castle Perilous, and was
named Lionês; Linet´ represents the “carnal
world,” which, like the inhabitants of
the City of Destruction, jest and jeer at
everything the Christian does. Sir Gareth
fought with four knights, keepers of the
roads “to Zion” or Castle Perilous, viz.,
Night, Dawn, Midday, and Evening, meaning
the temptations of the four ages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>man. Having conquered in all these, he
had to encounter the last enemy, which is
Death, and then the bride was won—the
bride who lived in Castle Perilous or
Mount Zion.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Tennyson, in his version of this
beautiful allegory, has fallen into several
grave errors, the worst of which is his
making Gareth marry Linet instead of the
true bride. This is like landing his Pilgrim
in the City of Destruction, after
having finished his journey and passed
the flood. Gareth’s <em>brother</em> was wedded
to the world (<i>i.e.</i> Linet), but Gareth himself
was married to the “true Bride,” who
dwelt in Castle Perilous. Another grave
error is making Death crave of Gareth
not to kill him, as what he did he was
compelled to do by his elder brothers. I
must confess that this to me is quite past
understanding.—See <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,

but when the Parisians promised to feed
his beast for nothing, he restored the peal.
This mare had a terrible tail “every
whit as big as the steeple of St. Mark’s,”
and on one occasion being annoyed by
wasps, she switched it about so vigorously
that she knocked down all the trees in the
vicinity. Gargantua roared with laughter,
and cried, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Je trouve beau ce!”</span> where

In 1780 the inhabitants associated themselves

“mayor” happened to be chosen on a
general election, and so it was decreed
that a new mayor should be appointed at
each general election. This made excellent
capital for electioneering squibs, and

manhood, he fought against the Saracens.
In Libya he heard of a huge dragon, to
which a damsel was daily given for food,
and it so happened that when he arrived

She was already tied to the stake when

<p class='c020'><b>Giaour</b> [<i>djow´.er</i>]. Byron’s tale called
<cite>The Giaour</cite> is supposed to be told by a
Turkish fisherman who had been employed
all the day in the gulf of Ægi´na,
and landed his boat at night-fall on the
Piræ´us, now called the harbor of Port
Leonê. He was eye-witness of all the
incidents, and in one of them a principal
agent (see line 352: “I hear the sound of
coming feet....”). The tale is this:
Leilah, the beautiful concubine of the
Caliph Hasson, falls in love with a giaour,
flees from the seraglio, is overtaken by an
emir, put to death, and cast into the sea.
The giaour cleaves Hassan’s skull, flees
for his life, and becomes a monk. Six
years afterwards he tells his history to his
father confessor on his death-bed, and prays
him to “lay his body with the humblest
dead, and not even to inscribe his name on
his tomb.” Accordingly, he is called “the
Giaour,” and is known by no other name

The bird was sold to a certain king, and,

Gil Blas went to Dr. Godinez’s school, of

of being a great scholar. He had
fair abilities, a kind heart, and good inclinations,
but was easily led astray by his
vanity. Full of wit and humor, but lax

those less experienced. As he grew in

<p class='c001'>(Lesage has borrowed largely from the

The other was born in Roslin, in the eighteenth

for “stealing sheep, horses and
oxen.” In the Percy <cite>Reliques</cite>, I. iii. 12,
is the lament of Gilderoy’s widow at the
execution of her “handsome” and “winsome”
Gilderoy; and Campbell has a ballad
on the same subject. Both are entitled
“Gilderoy,” and refer to the latter
robber; but in Thomson’s <cite>Orpheus Caledonius</cite>,
ii, is a copy of the older ballad.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Thomson’s ballad places Gilderoy
in the reign of Mary, “queen of Scots,”
but this is not consistent with the tradition
of his robbing Richelieu and Cromwell.

linen-draper agreed to make a family

Mrs. Gilpin, her sister, and four children
went in the chaise, and Gilpin promised to
follow on horseback. As madam had left
the wine behind, Gilpin girded it in two
stone bottles to his belt, and started on his
way. The horse, being fresh, began to
trot, and then to gallop; and John, being
a bad rider, grasped the mane with both
his hands. On went the horse, off flew John
Gilpin’s cloak, together with his hat and wig.
The dogs barked, the children screamed,

<p class='c020'><b>Glasgow Arms</b>, an oak tree with a bird

the branches; at the foot of the tree a
salmon with a ring in its mouth. The legend
is that St. Kentigern built the city
and hung a bell in an oak tree to summon
the men to work. This accounts for the
“oak and bell.” Now for the rest: A
Scottish queen, having formed an illicit
attachment to a soldier, presented her paramour
with a ring, the gift of her royal
husband. This coming to the knowledge
of the king, he contrived to abstract it
from the soldier while he was asleep, threw
it into the Clyde, and then asked his queen
to show it him. The queen, in great
alarm, ran to St. Kentigern, and confessed
her crime. The father confessor went to
the Clyde, drew out a salmon with the
ring in its mouth, handed it to the queen,
and by this means both prevented a scandal

Berry, wife of Thomas Elton of
Stratford Bow, and relict of Sir John Berry,

thus: A knight, passing by a cottage,
heard the cries of a woman in labor. By
his knowledge of the occult sciences, he
knew that the infant was doomed to be
his future wife; but he determined to
elude his destiny. When the child was of
a marriageable age, he took her to the seaside,
intending to drown her, but relented,
and, throwing a ring into the sea, commanded
her never to see his face again,
upon pain of death, till she brought back
that ring with her. The damsel now went
as cook to a noble family, and one day, as
she was preparing a cod-fish for dinner,
she found the ring in the fish, took it
to the knight, and thus became the bride
of Sir John Berry. The Berry arms show
a fish, and in the dexter chief a ring.</p>

fellow, impudent and insolent in manner,
who flirts with Widow Warren, and conspires
with her and the Jew Silky to destroy
Mr. Warren’s will. By this will the widow
was left £600 a year, but the bulk of the
property went to Jack Milford, his natural
son, and Sophia Freelove, the daughter of
Widow Warren by a former marriage.

obstacle, he was so delighted at seeing her
that he dropped his sword. In a moment

went to a farm-house, and taking a fancy to a
maid, does her work during the night. The
maid, watching him, and observing him rather
bare of clothes, provides him with garments,
which he puts out, laughing “Ho, ho, ho!”
He next changes himself into a Will-o-the-wisp,
to mislead a party of merry-makers, and
having misled them all night, he left them at
daybreak, with a “Ho, ho, ho!” At another
time, seeing a fellow ill-using a maiden, he
changed himself into a hare, ran between his
legs, and then growing into a horse, tossed him
into a hedge, laughing, “Ho, ho, ho!”—<cite>The Mad

<p class='c020'><b>Gor´loïs</b> (3 <i>syl.</i>), said by some to be the
father of King Arthur. He was lord of
Tintag´il Castle, in Cornwall; his wife was
Igrayne (3 <i>syl.</i>) or Igerna, and one of his
daughters (Bellicent) was, according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>some authorities, the wife of Lot, king of
Orkney.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Gorloïs was not the father of Arthur,
although his wife (Igrayne or Igerna)
was his mother.</p>

<p class='c021'>Then all the kings asked Merlin, “For what
cause is that beardless boy Arthur made king?”
“Sirs,” said Merlin, “because he is King Uther’s
son, born in wedlock ... More than three hours
after the death of Gorlois, did the king wed the
fair Igrayne.”—Malory, <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>,
i. 2, 6 (1470).</p>

<p class='c022'>[<i>Uther</i>] was sorry for the death of Gorlois, but
rejoiced that Igerna was now at liberty to marry
again ... they continued to live together with
much affection, and had a son and daughter,
whose names were Arthur and Anne.—Geoffrey,
<cite>British History</cite>, iii. 20 (1142).</p>

<p class='c020'>⁂ It is quite impossible to reconcile
the contradictory accounts of Arthur’s sister
and Lot’s wife. Tennyson says Bellicent,
but the tales compiled by Sir T. Malory
all give Margawse. Thus in <cite>La Mort
d’Arthur</cite>, i. 2, we read: “King Lot of
Lothan and of Orkeney wedded Margawse
[<i>Arthur’s sister</i>]” (pt. i. 36), “whose sons
were Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and
Gareth;” but Tennyson says Gareth
was “the last tall son of Lot and Bellicent.”</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Graal</b> (<i>Saint</i>) or <span class='sc'>St. Greal</span>, is generally
said to be the vessel or platter used by
Christ at the last supper, in which Joseph
of Arimathea caught the blood of the
crucified Christ. In all descriptions of it
in the Arthurian romances, it is simply
the visible “presence” of Christ, or realization
of the Catholic idea that the
wafer, after consecration, is changed into
the very body of the Saviour, and when
Sir Galahad “achieved the quest of the
Holy Graal,” all that is meant is that he
saw with his bodily eyes the visible
Saviour into which the holy wafer had
been transmuted.</p>

<p class='c021'>Then the bishop took a wafer, which was
made in the likeness of bread, and at the lifting
up [<em>the elevation of the host</em>] there came a figure
in the likeness of a child, and the visage was as
red and as bright as fire, and he smote himself
into that bread: so they saw that the bread was
formed of a fleshly man, and then he put it into
the holy vessel again ... then [<em>the bishop</em>] took
the holy vessel and came to Sir Galahad as he
kneeled down, and there he received his Saviour.—Pt.
iii. 101, 102.</p>

<p class='c020'>King Pelles and Sir Launcelot caught a
sight of the St. Graal; but did not
“achieve it,” like Galahad.</p>

<p class='c021'>When they went into the castle to take their
repast ... there came a dove to the window,
and in his bill was a little censer of gold, and
there withall was such a savor as if all the
spicery of the world had been there ... and a
damsel, passing fair, bare a vessel of gold between
her hands, and thereto the king kneeled
devoutly and said his prayers ... “Oh mercy!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>said Sir Launcelot, “what may this mean?”...
“This,” said the king, “is the holy Sancgreall
which ye have seen.”—Pt. iii. 2.</p>

<p class='c020'>When Sir Bors de Ganis went to Corbin,
and saw Galahad, the son of Sir Launcelot,
he prayed that the boy might prove as
good a knight as his father, and instantly
the white dove came with the golden
censer, and the damsel bearing the Sancgraal,
and told Sir Bors that Galahad
would prove a better knight than his
father, and would “achieve the Sancgreall;”
then both dove and damsel
vanished.—Pt. iii. 4.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Percival, the son of Sir Pellinore,
king of Wales, after his combat with Sir
Ector de Maris (brother of Sir Launcelot),
caught a sight of the Holy Graal, and both
were cured of their wounds thereby.
Like Sir Bors, he was with Sir Galahad
when the quest was achieved (pt. iii. 14).
Sir Launcelot was also miraculously cured
in the same way (pt. iii. 18).</p>

<p class='c001'>King Arthur, the queen, and all the 150
knights saw the Holy Graal as they sat at
supper when Galahad was received into
the fellowship of the Round Table:</p>

<p class='c021'>First they heard a crackling and crying of
thunder ... and in the midst of the blast
entered a sun-beam more clear by seven times
than ever they saw day, and all were lighted of
the grace of the Holy Ghost ... then there
entered the hall the Holy Greal [<em>consecrated bread</em>]
covered with white samite; but none might see
it, nor who bare it ... and when the Holy Greal
had been borne thro’ the hall, the vessel suddenly
departed.—Sir T. Malory, <i>History of Prince
Arthur</i>, iii. 35 (1470).</p>

to be for Jennie. He had not been gone
many days when Jennie’s mother fell sick,
her father broke his arm, and their cow
was stolen; then auld Robin came forward

loved the lass, and “wi’ tears in his ’ee,”
said, “Jennie, for their sakes, oh, marry
me!” Jennie’s heart said “nay,” for she
looked for Jamie back; but her father
urged her, and the mother pleaded with
her eye, and so she consented. They had
not been married above a month when

the command of Lord Thomas Howard.
While cruising near the Azores, a Spanish
fleet of fifty-three ships made towards the
English, and Lord Howard sheered off,
saying, “My ships are out of gear, and
how can six ships-of-the-line fight with
fifty-three?” Sir Richard Grenville, however,
resolved to stay and encounter the
foe, and “ship after ship the whole night
long drew back with her dead; some were
sunk, more were shattered;” and the
brave hundred still fought on. Sir Richard
was wounded and his ship riddled,
but his cry was still “Fight on!” When
resistance was no longer possible, he cried,
“Sink the ship, master gunner! sink her!
Split her in twain, nor let her fall into the
hands of the foe!” But the Spaniards
boarded her and praised Sir Richard for
his heroic daring. “I have done my duty
for my queen and faith,” he said, and died.
The Spaniards sent the prize home, but a

<p class='c001'><i>Gretchen</i>, a German diminutive of
Margaret; the heroine of Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite>.
Faust meets her on her return from

Gretchen destroys the infant to which she
gives birth, and is condemned to death.
Faust attempts to save her; and, gaining
admission to the dungeon, finds her huddled
on a bed of straw, singing wild
snatches of ballads, quite insane. He tries
to induce her to flee with him, but in
vain. At daybreak Gretchen dies, and
Faust is taken away.</p>

shine on purpose for Farmer Grundy;
that Dame Grundy’s butter was the crack
butter of the market. She then goes into

One day, as he was lying in ambush for Anselmo,
the vesper bell rang, and Gualberto
(3 <i>syl.</i>) fell in prayer, but somehow could
not pray. The thought struck him that
if Christ died to forgive sin, it could not
be right in man to hold it beyond forgiveness.
At this moment Anselmo came up,
was attacked, and cried for mercy. Gualberto
cast away his dagger, ran to the
neighboring convent, thanked God he had

the frail fair one, she offered him a parting

drop of the liquor fell on his horse and
burnt it so severely that it “lept twenty
feet high,” ran mad, and died. Arthur
dashed the cup on the ground, whereupon
it set fire to the grass and consumed the

reins of government, and her first act was
to throw Estrildis (her rival) and her

<p class='c020'><b>Guenever</b> or <b>Guinever</b>, a corrupt

King Leodegrance, of the land of Camelyard.
She was the most beautiful of women, was
the wife of King Arthur, but entertained
a criminal attachment for Sir Launcelot
du Lac. Respecting the latter part of the
queen’s history, the greatest diversity occurs.
Thus Geoffrey says:</p>

<p class='c021'>King Arthur was on his way to Rome ...
when news was brought him that his nephew
Mordred, to whose care he had entrusted Britain
had ... set the crown upon his own head; and
that the queen Guanhumara had wickedly
married him.... When King Arthur returned
and put Mordred and his army to flight ... the
queen fled from York to the City of Legions
[<cite>Newport in South Wales</cite>], where she resolved to
lead a chaste life among the nuns of Julius the
martyr.—<cite>British History</cite>, xi. 1 (1142).</p>

<p class='c020'>Another version is, that Arthur, being
informed of the adulterous conduct of
Launcelot, went with an army to Bentwick
(<cite>Brittany</cite>), to punish him. That Mordred
(his son by his own sister), left as regent,
usurped the crown, proclaimed that Arthur
was dead, and tried to marry Guenever,
the queen; but she shut herself up in the
Tower of London, resolved to die rather
than marry the usurper. When she heard
of the death of Arthur, she “stole away” to
Almesbury, “and there she let make herself
a nun, and wore white cloaths and
black.” And there lived she “in fasting,
prayers and almsdeeds, that all marvelled
at her virtuous life.”—Sir T. Malory, <cite>History
of Prince Arthur</cite>, iii, 161-170 (1470).</p>

Up to now, her love for her deformed

by him in a cave. When grown to manhood,
Belarius introduced them to the king

received them as his sons, and Guiderius

<p class='c001'>Geoffrey calls Cymbeline “Kymbelinus,

brought up by Augustus Cæsar, and adds,
“In his days was born our Lord Jesus
Christ.” Kymbeline reigned ten years,
when he was succeeded by Guiderius.
The historian says that Kymbeline <em>paid</em>
the tribute to the Romans, and that it was
Guiderius who refused to do so, “for which
reason Claudius the emperor marched

<p class='c001'><i>Guido</i> [<span class='sc'>Franceschini</span>], a reduced nobleman,
who tried to repair his fortune by
marrying Pompilia, the putative child of

was accomplished, and the money secure,
Guido ill-treated the putative parents;
and Violantê, in revenge, declared that
Pompilia was not their child at all, but
the offspring of a Roman wanton. Having
made this declaration, she next applied
to the law-courts for the recovery of
the money. When Guido heard this tale,
he was furious, and so ill-treated his
child-wife that she ran away, under the
protection of a young canon. Guido pursued
the fugitives, overtook them, and
had them arrested; whereupon the canon
was suspended for three years, and Pompilia
sent to a convent. Here her health
gave way, and as the birth of a child was
expected, she was permitted to leave the
convent and live with her putative parents.

the Italian machine (1791). In
1792 Antoine Louis introduced further
improvements, and hence the instrument
is sometimes called <i>Louisette, or Louison</i>.
The original Italian machine was called

to decapitate Beatrice Cenci, in
Rome, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1600.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was the popular theme for jests. It was

the “best cure for headache.” It “infallibly
prevented the hair from turning grey.” It “imparted
a peculiar delicacy to the complexion.”
It was the “national razor,” which shaved close.
Those “who kissed the guillotine, looked through
the little window and sneezed into the sack.”
It was the sign of “the regeneration of the
human race.” It “superseded the cross.”

Mordred, having discovered this familiarity,
“brought his creatures to the basement
of the tower for testimony.” Sir
Lancelot flung the fellow to the ground,
and instantly took to horse; while Guinevere
fled to the nunnery at Almesbury.
Here the king took leave of her; and when
the abbess died, the queen was appointed
her successor, and remained head of the

Haidée lighted on the lad, and, having

<p class='c020'><i>Hair.</i> Mrs. Astley, an actress of the
last century, wife of “Old Astley,” could
stand up and cover her feet with her flaxen
hair.</p>

<p class='c021'>She had such luxuriant hair that she could
stand upright and it covered her to her feet like
a veil. She was very proud of these flaxen locks;
and a slight accident by fire having befallen
them, she resolved ever after to play in a wig.
She used, therefore, to wind this immense quantity
of hair round her head, and put over it a
capacious caxon, the consequence of which was
that her head bore about the same proportion to
the rest of her figure that a whale’s skull does to
its body.—Philip Astley (1742-1814).</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Hair.</i> Mdlle. Bois de Chêne, exhibited

<p class='c020'><b>Hair Cut Off.</b> It was said by the
Greeks and Romans that life would not
quit the body of a devoted victim till a
lock of hair had first been cut from the
head of the victim and given to Proserpine.
Thus, when Alcestis was about to
die as a voluntary sacrifice for the life of
her husband, Than´atos first cut off a lock
of her hair for the queen of the infernals.
When Dido immolated herself, she could
not die till Iris had cut off one of her
yellow locks for the same purpose.—Virgil,

<p class='c020'><b>Hair, Sign of Rank.</b></p>

<p class='c001'>The Parthians and ancient Persians of
high rank wore long flowing hair.</p>

<p class='c001'>Homer speaks of “the long-haired
Greeks” by way of honorable distinction.
Subsequently the Athenian cavalry wore
long hair, and all Lacedæmonian soldiers
did the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Gauls considered long hair a notable
honor, for which reason Julius Cæsar
obliged them to cut off their hair in token
of submission.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Franks and ancient Germans considered
long hair a mark of noble birth.
Hence Clodion, the Frank, was called “The
Long-Haired,” and his successors are
spoken of as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>les rois chevelures</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Goths looked on long hair as a

and dogmatical. Lady Nelly tried to
“forget the dunghill whence she grew, and
thought herself the Lord knows who.”
Her extravagance was so great that Sir Abel
said his “best coal-pit would not find her
in white muslin, nor his India bonds in
shawls and otto of roses.” It turned out
that her first husband, Gerald, who had
been absent twenty years, reappeared and
claimed her. Sir Abel willingly resigned
his claim, and gave Gerald £5000 to take
her off his hands.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Robert Handy</i> (always called <i>Bob</i>), son

he could do everything better than any

but broke the horse’s knees. He taught
Farmer Ashfield how to box, but got
knocked down by him at the first blow.
He told Dame Ashfield he had learned
lace-making at Mechlin, and that she did
not make it in the right way; but he spoilt
her cushion in showing her how to do it.
He told Lady Handy (his father’s bride)
she did not know how to use the fan, and
showed her; he told her she did not know
how to curtsey, and showed her. Being
pestered by this popinjay beyond endurance,
she implored her husband to protect
her from further insults. Though light-hearted,
Bob was “warm, steady, and sincere.”

<p class='c020'><i>Hassan</i> surnamed <i>Al Habbal</i> (“the rope-maker”),
and subsequently <i>Cogia</i> (“merchant”);
his full name was then Cogia
Hassan Alhabbal. Two friends, named
Saad and Saadi, tried an experiment on
him. Saadi gave him 200 pieces of gold
in order to see if it would raise him from
extreme poverty to affluence. Hassan
took ten pieces for immediate use, and
sewed the rest in his turban; but a kite
pounced on his turban and carried it
away. The two friends, after a time,
visited Hassan again, but found him in
the same state of poverty; and, having
heard his tale, Saadi gave him another
200 pieces of gold. Again he took out ten
pieces, and, wrapping the rest in a linen
rag, hid it in a jar of bran. While Hassan
was at work, his wife exchanged this
jar of bran for fuller’s earth, and again
the condition of the man was not bettered
by the gift. Saad now gave the rope-maker
a small piece of lead, and this
made his fortune thus: A fisherman
wanted a piece of lead for his nets, and
promised to give Hassan for Saad’s piece
whatever he caught in his first draught.
This was a large fish, and in it the wife
found a splendid diamond, which was sold
for 100,000 pieces of gold. Hassan now
became very rich, and when the two friends
visited him again, they found him a man
of consequence. He asked them to stay
with him, and took them to his country
house, when one of his sons showed him
a curious nest, made out of a turban.
This was the very turban which the kite
had carried off, and the money was found
in the lining. As they returned to the
city, they stopped and purchased a jar of
bran. This happened to be the very jar
which the wife had given in exchange,
and the money was discovered wrapped
in linen at the bottom. Hassan was
delighted, and gave the 180 pieces to the
poor.—<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> (“Cogia Hassan

mocking their cries of agony. He, like
Hatto, was invaded by mice, ran to his
castle of Güttingen, in the lake of Constance,
whither the vermin pursued him,
and ate him alive. The Swiss legend says
the castle sank in the lake, and may
still be seen. Freiherr von Güttingen had
three castles, one of which was Moosburg.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Walter Scott has a novel so called
(1818), the plot of which is as follows:—Effie
Deans, the daughter of a Scotch cow-feeder,
is seduced by George Staunton,
son of the rector of Willingham; and
Jeanie is cited as a witness on the trial
which ensues, by which Effie is sentenced
to death for child murder. Jeanie promises
to go to London and ask the
king to pardon her half-sister, and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>various perils, arrives at her destination.
She lays her case before the duke of Argyll,
who takes her in his carriage to Richmond,
and obtains for her an interview with the
queen, who promises to intercede with his
majesty (George II.) on her sister’s behalf.
In due time the royal pardon is sent to
Edinburgh, Effie is released, and marries
her seducer, now Sir George Staunton; but
some years after the marriage Sir George is
shot by a gypsy boy, who is in reality his
illegitimate son. On the death of her husband,
Lady Staunton retires to a convent
on the continent. Jeanie marries Reuben
Butler, the Presbyterian minister. The
novel opens with the Porteous riots.</p>

whose son Bertram she fell in love
with. The king sent for Bertram to the

join the army of the duke of Florence.
Helena, in the mean time, started on a
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Jacques le

her more “till she could get the ring from
off his finger.” On her way to the shrine,
she lodged at Florence with a widow, the
mother of Diana, with whom Bertram was
wantonly in love. Helena was permitted
to pass herself off as Diana, and received his
visits, in one of which they exchanged
rings. Both soon after this returned to the
Countess de Rousillon, where the king was,

the river Achĕron, and in this division of
inferno dwell the spirits of the heathen
philosophers. Circle 2 is presided over by
Minos, and here are the spirits of those
guilty of carnal and sinful love. Circle
3 is guarded by Cerbĕrus, and this is the
region set apart for gluttons. Circle 4,
presided over by Plutus, is the realm of
the avaricious. Circle 5 contains the
Stygian Lake, and here flounder in deep
mud those who in life put no restraint on
their anger. Circle 6 (in the city of Dis)
is for those who did violence to man by
force or fraud. Circle 7 (in the city of Dis)
is for suicides. Circle 8 (also in the city
of Dis) is for blasphemers and heretics.
After the eight circles comes the ten pits
or chasms of Malebolgê (<i>4 syl.</i>), the last of
which is the centre of the earth, and here
he says is the frozen river of Cocy´tus.

left to perish. The child was driven by a
storm to the “coast” of Bohemia, and
brought up by a shepherd who called her
Per´dĭta. Florĭzel, the son of Polixenês,
king of Bohemia, fell in love with her, and
they fled to Sicily to escape the vengeance
of the angry king. Being introduced to

was his lost daughter, and Polixenês

She was betrothed to Orestês, but

father in marriage to Pyrrhus, king of
Epirus. Orestes madly loved her, but
Hermione as madly loved Pyrrhus. When
Pyrrhus fixed his affections on Androm´achê

the pride and jealousy of Hermione were
roused. At this crisis, an embassy led by
Orestês arrived at the court of Pyrrhus, to
demand the death of Asty´anax, the son of
Andromachê and Hector, lest when he
grew to manhood he might seek to avenge
his father’s death. Pyrrhus declined to
give up the boy, and married Andromachê.

<p class='c020'><b>Hermit and the Youth</b> (<i>The</i>). A hermit,
desirous to study the ways of Providence,
met with a youth, who became his
companion. The first night, they were
most hospitably entertained by a nobleman,
but at parting the young man stole
his entertainer’s golden goblet. Next day,
they obtained with difficulty of a miser
shelter from a severe storm, and at parting
the youth gave him the golden goblet.
Next night, they were modestly but freely
welcomed by one of the middle class, and
at parting the youth “crept to the cradle
where an infant slept, and wrung its
neck.” It was the only child of their kind
host. Leaving the hospitable roof, they
lost their way, and were set right by a
guide, whom the youth pushed into a
river, and he was drowned. The hermit
began to curse the youth, when lo! he
turned into an angel, who thus explained
his acts:</p>

<p class='c021'>“I stole the goblet from the rich lord to
teach him not to trust in uncertain riches. I
gave the goblet to the miser to teach him that
kindness always meets its reward. I strangled
the infant because the man loved it better than
he loved God. I pushed the guide into the
river because he intended at night-fall to commit
a robbery.” The hermit bent his head and cried,
“The ways of the Lord are past finding out!
but He doeth all things well. Teach me to say
with faith, ‘Thy will be done?’”—Parnell. (1679-1717).</p>

<p class='c020'>In the <cite>Talmud</cite> is a similar and better
allegory. Rabbi Jachanan accompanied
Elijah on a journey, and they came to the
house of a poor man, whose only treasure
was a cow. The man and his wife ran to
meet and welcome the strangers, but next
morning the poor man’s cow died. Next
night they were coldly received by a proud,
rich man, who fed them only with bread
and water; and next morning Elijah sent
for a mason to repair a wall which was
falling down, in return for the hospitality
received. Next night they entered a synagogue,
and asked, “Who will give a night’s
lodging to two travellers!” but none offered
to do so. At parting, Elijah said, “I hope
you will all be made presidents.” The
following night they were lodged by the
members of another synagogue in the best
hotel of the place, and at parting Elijah
said, “May the Lord appoint over you
but one president.” The rabbi, unable
to keep silence any longer, begged Elijah
to explain the meaning of his dealings
with men; and Elijah replied:</p>

<p class='c021'>“In regard to the poor man who received us
so hospitably, it was decreed that his wife was to
die that night, but, in reward of his kindness,
God took the cow instead of the wife. I repaired
the wall of the rich miser because a chest of
gold was concealed near the place, and if the
miser had repaired the wall he would have discovered
the treasure. I said to the inhospitable
synagogue, ‘May each member be president,’
because no one can serve two masters. I said
to the hospitable synagogue, <a id='corr167R.45'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“May'>‘May</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_167R.45'><ins class='correction' title='“May'>‘May</ins></a></span> you have but

<p class='c001'><i>Hood</i> (<i>Robin</i>), a famous English outlaw.
Stow places him in the reign of
Richard I., but others make him live at
divers periods between Cœur de Lion and
Edward II. His chief haunt was Sherwood
Forest, in Nottinghamshire. Ancient
ballads abound with anecdotes of his personal
courage, his skill in archery, his
generosity, and great popularity. It is
said that he robbed the rich, but gave
largely to the poor, and protected women
and children with chivalrous magnanimity.
The ballad, “The Death of Robin
Hood,” says that he was treacherously bled
to death by his sister, the Prioress of the
Abbey of Kirklees.</p>

<p class='c001'>Stukeley asserts that Robin Hood was
Robert Fitzooth, earl of Huntingdon;
and it is probable that his name <em>hood</em>, like
<em>capet</em> given to the French king of the
Hugues, refers to the cape or hood which
he usually wore.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ The chief incidents of his life are
recorded by Stow. Ritson has collected a
volume of songs, ballads, and anecdotes
called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Robin Hood ... that Celebrated
English Outlaw</i></span> (1795). Sir W. Scott has
introduced him in his famous novel <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Ivanhoe</i></span>,
which makes the outlaw contemporary
with Cœur de Lion.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Robin Hood’s Men.</i> The most noted of
his followers were Little John, whose
surname was Nailor; his chaplain, Friar
Tuck; William Scarlet, Scathelooke (2

brothers; Will Stutly or Stukely; Mutch,

wore,” and lamented the cruel orders that
forbade them to attack the foe, for “with
twenty ships he surely could have achieved

this: An ape and a fox went into partnership
to seek their fortunes. They resolved
to begin their adventures as beggars, so
Master Ape dressed himself as a broken
soldier, and Reynard pretended to be his
dog. After a time they came to a farmer,
who employed the ape as shepherd, but
when the rascals had so reduced the flock
that detection was certain, they decamped.
Next they tried the Church, under advice
of a priest; Reynard was appointed rector
to a living, and the ape was his parish
clerk. From this living they were obliged
also to remove. Next they went to court
as foreign potentates, and drove a splendid
business, but came to grief ere long.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Lastly, they saw King Lion asleep, his
skin was lying beside him, with his crown
and sceptre. Master Ape stole the regalia,
dressed himself as King Lion, usurped the
royal palace, made Reynard his chief minister,
and collected round him a band of
monsters, chiefly amphibious, as his guard
and court. In time Jupiter sent Mercury
to rouse King Lion from his lethargy; so
he awoke from sleep, broke into his palace,
and bit off the ape’s tail, with a part of its

she was introduced to Sir Thomas Clifford,
and they plighted their troth to each
other. Then came a change. Clifford lost
his title and estates, while Julia went to
London, became a votary of fashion and
pleasure, abandoned Clifford, and promised
marriage to Wilford, earl of Rochdale.
The day of espousals came. The love of
Julia for Clifford revived, and she implored
her guardian to break off the obnoxious
marriage. Master Walter now
showed himself to be the earl of Rochdale,
and the father of Julia; the marriage with
Wilford fell through, and Julia became the

out of fear, carried the body to the house
of a physician, and the physician, stumbling
against it, knocked it downstairs.
Thinking he had killed the man, he let
the body down a chimney into the store-room
of his neighbor, who was a purveyor.
The purveyor, supposing it to be
a thief, belabored it soundly; and then,
thinking he had killed the little humpback,
carried the body into the street, and
set it against a wall. A Christian merchant,
reeling home, stumbled against the
body, and gave it a blow with his fist.
Just then the patrol came up, and arrested
the merchant for murder. He was condemned
to death; but the purveyor came
forward and accused himself of being the
real offender. The merchant was accordingly
released, and the purveyor
condemned to death; but then the physician
appeared, and said he had killed
the man by accident, having knocked
him downstairs. When the purveyor
was released, and the physician led away
to execution, the tailor stepped up, and
told his tale. All were then taken before
the sultan, and acquitted; and the sultan
ordered the case to be enrolled in the

<b>Iachimo</b> [<i>Eák´.ĭ.mo</i>], an
Italian libertine. When
Posthu´mus, the husband of
Imogen, was banished for
marrying the king’s daughter,
he went to Rome, and
in the house of Philario the conversation
fell on the fidelity of wives. Posthumus
bet a diamond ring that nothing could
change the fidelity of Imogen, and Iachimo
accepted the wager. The libertine contrived
to get into a chest in Imogen’s
chamber, made himself master of certain
details, and took away with him a bracelet
belonging to Imogen. With these vouchers,
Iachimo easily persuaded Posthumus that
he had won the bet, and Posthumus handed
over to him the ring. A battle subsequently
ensued, in which Iachimo and
other Romans, with Imogen disguised as
a page, were made prisoners, and brought
before King Cymbeline. Imogen was set
free, and told to ask a boon. She asked
that Iachimo might be compelled to say
how he came by the ring which he had on
his finger, and the whole villainy was
brought to light. Posthumus was pardoned,
and all ended happily—Shakespeare,
<cite>Cymbeline</cite> (1605).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ The tale of <cite>Cymbeline</cite> is from the
<cite>Decameron</cite> of Boccaccio (day ii. 9), in
which Iachimo is called “Ambrose,”
Imogen is “Zineura,” her husband, Bernard
“Lomellin,” and Cymbeline is the
“sultan.” The assumed name of Imogen
is “Fidelê,” but in Boccaccio it is “Sicurano
da Finale.”</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Ia´go</b> (3 <i>syl.</i>), ancient of Othello, commander
of the Venetian army, and husband
of Emilia. Iago hated Othello, both
because Cassio (a Florentine) was promoted
to the lieutenancy over his head,
and also from a suspicion that the Moor
had tampered with his wife; but he concealed
his hatred so artfully that Othello
felt confident of his “love and honesty.”
Iago strung together such a mass of circumstantial
evidence in proof of Desdemona’s
love for Cassio, that the Moor
killed her out of jealousy. One main argument
was that Desdemona had given
Cassio the very handkerchief which Othello
had given her as a love-gift; but in reality
Iago had induced his wife Emilia to purloin
the handkerchief. When this villainy
was brought to light, Othello stabbed
Iago; but his actual death is no incident
of the tragedy.—Shakespeare, <cite>Othello</cite>
(1611).</p>

<p class='c021'>The cool malignity of Iago, silent in his resentment,
subtle in his designs, and studious at
once of his interest and his vengeance,...are
such proofs of Shakespeare’s skill in human nature
as it would be vain to seek in any modern
writer.—Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p class='c020'>⁂ Bryon, speaking of John P. Kemble,
says: “Was not his ’Iago’ perfection—particularly

him, and I never saw an English countenance

Troy, an epic poem in twenty-four books,
by Homer. Menelāos, king of Sparta, received
as a guest, Paris, a son of Priam,
king of Troy. Paris eloped with Helen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>his host’s wife, and Menelaos induced the
Greeks to lay siege to Troy, to avenge the
perfidy. The siege lasted ten years, when
Troy was taken and burned to the ground.
Homer’s poem is confined to the last year
of the siege.</p>

<p class='c001'>Book I. opens with a pestilence in the
Grecian camp, sent by the sun-god to
avenge his priest, Chrysês. The case is
this: Chrysês wished to ransom his
daughter, whom Agamemnon, the Greek
commander-in-chief, kept as a concubine,
but Agamemnon refused to give her up;
so the priest prayed to Apollo for vengeance,
and the god sent a pestilence. A
council being called, Achillês upbraids
Agamemnon as the cause of the divine
wrath, and Agamemnon replies he will
give up the priest’s daughter, but shall take
instead Achillês’ concubine. On hearing
this, Achillês declares he will no longer
fight for such an extortionate king, and
accordingly retires to his tent and sulks
there.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. Jupiter, being induced to take the
part of Achillês, now sends to Agamemnon
a lying dream, which induces him to
believe that he shall take the city at once;
but in order to see how the soldiers are
affected by the retirement of Achillês, the
king calls them to a council of war, asks
them if it would not be better to give up
the siege and return home. He thinks the
soldiers will shout “no” with one voice;
but they rush to their ships, and would set
sail at once if they were not restrained by
those privy to the plot.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. The soldiers, being brought back,
are then arrayed for battle. Paris proposes
to decide the contest by single combat,
and Menelaos accepts the challenge.
Paris, being overthrown, is carried off by
Venus, and Agamemnon demands that the
Trojans shall give up Troy in fulfillment
of the compact.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. While Agamemnon is speaking,

and wounds him, and the battle becomes

is killed by Diomed.</p>

<p class='c001'>VI. Hector, the general of the Trojan

women in a body should supplicate
the gods to pardon the sin of Pandarus,
and in the meantime he and Paris make
a sally from the city gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>VII. Hector fights with Ajax in single
combat, but the combatants are parted
by the heralds, who declare it a drawn battle;
so they exchange gifts and return
to their respective tents.</p>

<p class='c001'>VIII. The Grecian host, being discomfitted,
retreats; and Hector prepares to
assault the enemy’s camp.</p>

<p class='c001'>IX. A deputation is sent to Achillês, but
the sulky hero remains obdurate.</p>

<p class='c001'>X. A night attack is made on the Trojans
by Diomed and Ulyssês;</p>

<p class='c001'>XI. And the three Grecian chiefs
(Agamemnon, Diomed, and Ulyssês) are
all wounded.</p>

Grecian ramparts.</p>

<p class='c001'>XIII. A tremendous battle ensues in
which many on both sides are slain.</p>

<p class='c001'>XIV. While Jupiter is asleep, Neptune
interferes in the quarrel in behalf of the
Greeks;</p>

<p class='c001'>XV. But Jupiter rebukes him, and
Apollo, taking the side of the Trojans, puts
the Grecians to a complete rout. The
Trojans, exulting in their success, prepare
to set fire to the Grecian camp.</p>

<p class='c001'>XVI. In this extremity, Patroclos arrays
himself in Achillês’ armor, and leads the
Myrmĭdons to the fight; but he is slain by
Hector.</p>

<p class='c001'>XVII. Achillês is told of the death of
his friend,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>XVIII. Resolves to return to the battle;</p>

<p class='c001'>XIX. And is reconciled to Agamemnon.</p>

<p class='c001'>XX. A general battle ensues, in which
the gods are permitted to take part.</p>

<p class='c001'>XXI. The battle rages with great fury,
the slaughter is frightful; but the Trojans,
being routed, retreat into their town, and
close the gates.</p>

<p class='c001'>XXII. Achillês slays Hector before he
is able to enter the gates, and the battle is
at an end. Nothing now remains but</p>

<p class='c001'>XXIII. To burn the body of Patroclos,
and celebrate the funeral games.</p>

<p class='c001'>XXIV. Old Priam, going to the tent of
Achillês, craves the body of his son Hector;
Achillês gives it up, and the poem
concludes with the funeral rites of the
Trojan hero.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Virgil continues the tale from this

to the throne. (See <span class='sc'>Æneid</span>).</p>

of crystal, and contained everything the

leaving it. For a time Imis and Philax

<p class='c020'><b>Immo and Hildegard.</b> As the sun
went down, it threw its golden light over
the heights on which the Idisburg stands.
The old tower glowed, bathed in the
many-colored light, and the branches of
the bramble-berry overspread the low wall
of the castle with a net work of purple
and gold. In the lower portion of the
enclosed court, the children of the townspeople,
brought there by their parents,
were shouting and calling in their play.
On the highest point within the castle
wall, stands a linden tree, that makes a
thick arbor, with its broad leaves reaching
nearly to the ground. It was a lovely
spot. Wild hare-bells bloomed in its light
shade, and little butterflies fluttered here
and there. The birds gathered their
young ones together in the sheltering
branches of the tree, and the crickets
chirped in chorus to the note of the
feathered songsters. Here sat Hildegard,
the count’s daughter, her hands folded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>her lap as she looked down into the valley,
over the fields of heather, over the forest
trees, and over the rolling hills, far into
the distance, where earth and sky seemed
to melt together in the evening glow.
At a respectful distance, some old servingmen,
who had been sent up there for her
protection, were lying on the ground, but
their backs were turned to the maiden
as they looked down to the Main, and
pointed out to one another the border
towns of the enemy, descried under the
light clouds. Where Hildegard sat all
was still; only a few sounds from the
bustling camp made their way up to her.
From one side came the lowing of the
cows, and every now and then a hoof
drew nearer, and the leaves of her tree
were pulled about, and there was a crackling
and a rustling in the branches.
Hildegard turned and scared away the
intruders, but they came back again, and
the maiden at last forgot in her dreaming
her dainty-mouthed visitors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her lips stirred, and softly sounded the
words of a holy hymn, as she sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Audi, benigne Conditor,</div>

      <div class='line'>Our prayers and our weeping.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>But, in her singing, her thoughts dwelt
less on the Creator than on a certain
suppliant who, only a few weeks before,
had repeated these same words to her in
jest. And while she sang, and with
clear eyes looked straight before her, it
seemed to her that her song was echoed
from above her in the tree. She stopped
singing; then there was a rustling in the
branches, and through the whispering of
the leaves, she heard the same air repeated
above her head, but to other words; and
she heard from the height:</p>

<p class='c020'>Hildegard sat motionless; a smile hovered
about her mouth, and a deep blush
suffused her cheek; but she dared not risk
looking up, for fear lest the pleasant
dream should be ended. “Is it thou, my
comrade?” she softly murmured. But
hardly had she spoken before she repented
the too familiar speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am lying <a id='corr205R.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='her'>here</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_205R.11'><ins class='correction' title='her'>here</ins></a></span> above thee, in the

overhead. “Right comfortable is my bed
on the strong branch; look upward, if so
please thee, that I may once more see
those large eyes of thine, since it is they
that have brought me hither.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The maiden sprang lightly up, and
turned toward the branch. In the same
instant Immo thrust his head quickly
out, and clinging to the branch with one
hand he threw the other round her neck,
and kissed her on the mouth. “Good
day, comrade,” he said. “That is what I
made up my mind to do, and I have done
it!” He looked out once more from his
hiding-place, and gazed tenderly upon her
blushing cheek.—Gustav Freytag, <cite>The

Posthumus Leonātus; and Posthumus,
being banished for the offence,
retired to Rome. One day, in the house
of Philario, the conversation turned on
the merits of wives, and Posthumus bet
his diamond ring that nothing could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>tempt the fidelity of Imogen. Iachimo

after due time induced Posthumus to
believe that Imogen had played false,
showing, by the way of proof, a bracelet,
which he affirmed she had given him;
so Posthumus handed over to him the
ring given him by Imogen at parting.
Posthumus now ordered his servant
Pisanio to inveigle Imogen to Milford
Haven, under pretence of seeing her husband,
and to murder her on the road;
but Pisanio told Imogen his instructions,
advised her to enter the service of
Lucius, the Roman general in Britain,
as a page, and promised that he would
make Posthumus believe that she was
dead. This was done; and not long
afterwards a battle ensued, in which the
Romans were defeated, and Lucius,
Iachimo, and Imogen were taken prisoners.
Posthumus also took part in the
battle, and obtained for his services
the royal pardon. The captives being
brought before Cymbeline, Lucius entreated
the king to liberate Imogen.
The petition was not only granted, but
Imogen was permitted, at the same time,
to ask a boon of the British king. She
only begged that Iachimo should inform
the court how he came by the ring he
was wearing on his finger. The whole
villainy was thus revealed, a reconciliation
took place, and all ended happily.

of English at Copenhagen. He gave
out that he had discovered, in 1747, in the
library of that city, a book entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
Situ Britanniæ</cite></span>, by Richardus Corinensis.
He published this with two other treatises
(one by Gildas Badon´icus, and the other
by Nennius Banchorensis) in 1757. The

false quotations from Masenius, a Jesuit
of Cologne, Taubman, a German, Staphorstius,
a learned Dutchman, and others, to
“prove Milton a gross plagiarist.” Dr.
Douglas demonstrated that the citations
were incorrect, and that often several lines

<p class='c001'>5. <span class='sc'>Mentz</span>, who lived in the ninth century,
published fifty-nine decretals, which

to enforce some law assuming such exaltation.
Among them is the decretal of St.

with the decretals of St. Anaclētus, St.

<p class='c001'><i>Inez (Donna)</i>, mother of Don Juan.
She trained her son according to prescribed
rules with the strictest propriety, and
designed to make him a model of all
virtues. Her husband was Don José,
whom she worried to death by her prudery
and want of sympathy. Donna Inez was
a “blue-stocking,” learned in all the
sciences, her favorite one being “the
mathematical.” She knew every European
language, “a little Latin and less
Greek.” In a word, she was “perfect as
perfect is,” according to the standard of
Miss Edgeworth, Mrs. Trimmer, and Hannah
More, but had “a great opinion of her
own good qualities.” Like Tennyson’s
“Maud,” this paragon of women was, to
those who did not look too narrowly,
“faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly
null.”—Bryon, <cite>Don Juan</cite>, i. 10-30
(1819).</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Inez de Castro</b>, crowned six years after
her death. The tale is this: Don Pedro,
son of Alfonso IV. of Portugal, privately
married, in 1345, the “beauty of Castile,”
and Alfonso was so indignant that he
commanded her to be put to death (1355).
Two years afterwards, Don Pedro succeeded
to the crown, and in 1361 had the
body of Inez exhumed and crowned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Camoens, the Portuguese poet, has introduced
this story in his <cite>Lusiad</cite>. A.
Ferreira, another Portuguese poet, has a

his minister Gonzalez, not knowing of
this marriage, arranged a marriage for the
young prince with a Spanish princess, and
when the prince refused his consent, Gonzalez
ferreted out the cause, and induced
Inez to drink poison. He then put the
young prince under arrest, but as he was
being led away, the announcement came
that Alfonso was dead and Don Pedro was
his successor. The tables were now
turned, for Pedro was instantly released,
and Gonzalez led to execution.—Ross

<p class='c020'><b>Inferno</b> (<i>The</i>), in thirty-four cantos,
by Dantê [Alighieri] (1300). While wandering
through a wood (<em>this life</em>), the poet
comes to a mountain (<em>fame</em>), and begins
to climb it, but first a panther (<em>pleasure</em>),
then a lion (<em>ambition</em>), and then a she-wolf
(<em>avarice</em>), stand in his path to slay him.
The appearance of Virgil (<em>human wisdom</em>),
however, encourages him (canto i.), and
the Mantuan tells him he is sent by three
ladies [Beatrice (<em>faith</em>), Lucia (<em>grace</em>), and
Mercy] to conduct him through the
realms of hell (canto ii.). On they proceed
together till they come to a portal bearing
this inscription: <span class='fss'>ALL HOPE ABANDON YE
WHO ENTER HERE</span>; they pass through, and
come to that neutral realm where dwell
the spirits of those not good enough for
heaven nor bad enough for hell, “the
praiseless and the blameless dead.” Passing
through this border-land, they command
old Charon to ferry them across the
Achĕron to Limbo (canto iii.), and here
they behold the ghosts of the unbaptized,
“blameless of sin,” but not members of
the Christian Church. Homer is here,
Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who enroll
Dantê “sixth of the sacred band.” On leaving
Limbo, our adventurer follows his
guide through the seven gates which lead
to the inferno, an enormous funnel-shaped
pit, divided into stages. The outer, or
first “circle,” is a vast meadow, in which
roam Electra (mother of Dardănus, the
founder of Troy), Hector, Æne´as, and
Julius Cæsar; Camilla and Penthesile´a;
Latīnus and Junius Brutus; Lucretia,
Marcia (Cato’s wife), Julia (Pompey’s
wife), and Cornelia; and here “a part
retired,” they see Saladin, the rival of
Richard the Lion-heart. Linos is here
and Orpheus; Aristotle, Socratês, and
Plato; Democrĭtos, who ascribed creation
to blind chance, Diogĕnês, the cynic,
Heraclītos, Emped´oclês, Anaxag´oras,
Thalĕs, Dioscor´idês, and Zeno; Cicero
and Senĕca, Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrătês
and Galen, Avĭcen, and Averroês,
the Arabian translator and commentator
of Aristotle (canto iv.). From the first
stage they descend to the second, where
Minos sits in judgment on the ghosts
brought before him. He indicates what
circle a ghost is to occupy by twisting his
tail round his body: two twists signify
that the ghost is to be banished to the
second circle; three twists that it is to be
consigned to the third circle, and so on.
Here, says the poet, “light was silent all,”
but shrieks and groans and blasphemies
were terrible to hear. This circle is the
hell of carnal and sinful love, where Dante
recognizes Semirămis, Dido, Cleopatra,
and Helen; Achillês and Paris; Tristan,
the lover of his uncle’s wife, Isoldê;
Lancelot, the lover of Queen Guinever;
and Francesca, the lover of Paolo, her
brother-in-law (canto v.). The third circle
is a place of deeper woe. Here fall in
ceaseless showers, hail, black rain, and
sleety flaw; the air is cold and dun; and
a foul stench arises from the soil. Cerbĕrus
keeps watch here, and this part of the
inferno is set apart for gluttons, like Ciacco
(2 <i>syl.</i>). From this stage the two poets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>pass on to the “fourth steep ledge,” presided
over by Plutus (canto vi.), a realm
which “hems in all the woe of all the
universe.” Here are gathered the souls of
the avaricious, who wasted their talents,
and made no right use of their wealth.
Crossing this region, they come to the
“fifth steep,” and see the Stygian Lake
of inky hue. This circle is a huge bog in
which “the miry tribe” flounder, and
“gulp the muddy lees.” It is the abode of
those who put no restraint upon their
anger (canto vii.). Next comes the city of
Dis, where the souls of heretics are “interred
in vaults” (cantos viii., ix.). Here
Dantê recognizes Farina´ta (a leader of
the Ghibelline faction), and is informed
that the Emperor Frederick II. and Cardinal
Ubaldini are amongst the number
(canto x.). The city of Dis contains the
next three circles (canto xi.), through which
Nessus conducts them; and here they see
the Minotaur and the Centaurs, as Chiron,
who nursed Achillês and Pholus the passionate.
The first circle of Dis (the sixth)
is for those who by force or fraud have
done violence to <em>man</em>, as Alexander the
Great, Dionysius of Syracuse, Attila, Sextus,
and Pyrrhus (canto xii.). The next
(the seventh circle) is for those who have
done violence to <em>themselves</em>, as suicides;
here are the Harpies, and here the souls
are transformed to trees (canto xiii.). The
eighth circle is for the souls of those who
have done violence to <em>God</em>, as blasphemers
and heretics; it is a hell of burning,
where it snows flakes of fire. Here is
Cap´aneus (3 <i>syl.</i>) (canto xiv.), and here
Dantê held converse with Brunetto, his
old schoolmaster (canto xv.). Having
reached the confines of the realm of Dis,
Ger´yon carries Dantê into the region of
Malêbolgê (4 <i>syl.</i>), a horrible hell, containing
ten pits or chasms (canto xvii.): In
the first is Jason; the second is for harlots
(canto xviii.); in the third is Simon
Magus, “who prostituted the things of
God for gold;” in the fourth, Pope Nicholas
III. (canto xix.); in the fifth the ghosts
had their heads “reversed at the neckbone,”
and here are Amphiarāos, Tirēsias,
who was first a woman and then a man,
Michael Scott, the magician, with all
witches and diviners (canto xx.); in the
sixth, Caïaphas and Annas, his father-in-law
(canto xxiii.); in the seventh, robbers
of churches, as Vanni Fucci, who robbed
the sacristy of St James’ in Pistoia,
and charged Venni della Nona with the
crime, for which she suffered death (canto
xxiv.); in the eighth, Ulyssês and Diomed,
who were punished for the stratagem
of the Wooden Horse (cantos xxvi.,
xxvii.); in the ninth, Mahomet and Ali,
“horribly mangled” (canto xxviii.); in the
tenth, alchemists (canto xxix.), coiners and
forgers, Potiphar’s wife, Sinon the Greek,
who deluded the Trojans (canto xxx.), Nimrod,
Ephialtés, and Antæus, with other
giants (canto xxxi.). Antæus carries the two
visitors into the nethermost gulf, where
Judas and Lucifer are confined. It is a
region of thick-ribbed ice, and here they
see the frozen river of Cocy´tus (canto
xxxii.). The last persons the poet sees are
Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of
Julius Cæsar (canto xxxiv.). Dantê and
his conductor, Virgil, then make their
exit on the “southern hemisphere,” where
once was Eden, and where the “moon
rises when here evening sets.” This is
done that the poet may visit Purgatory,
which is situated in mid-ocean, somewhere
near the antipodes of Judea.</p>

privately instructed his steward to “fill

Isolt <em>the Fair</em>; and Isolt hated Sir Mark,
her husband, with the same measure that
she loved Sir Tristram, her nephew-in-law.
Tennyson’s tale of the death of Sir Tristram
is so at variance with the romance,
that it must be given separately. He says
that Sir Tristram was one day dallying

Sir Marhaus, he went to Ireland to be
cured of his wounds. La Beale Isond was
his leech, and fell in love with him; but
she married Sir Mark, the dastard king of
Cornwall. This marriage was very unhappy,
for Isond hated Mark as much as she
loved Sir Tristram, with whom she eloped
and lived in Joyous Guard Castle, but was
in time restored to her husband, and Tristram
married Isond the <cite>Fair-handed</cite>. In
the process of time, Tristram, being severely
wounded, sent for La Beale Isond, who
alone could cure him, and if the lady consented
to come the vessel was to hoist a
white flag. The ship hove in sight, and

it carried a <em>black</em> flag at the mast-head.
On hearing this Sir Tristram fell back on
his bed and died. When La Beale Isond
landed, and heard that Sir Tristram was
dead, she flung herself on the body, and died
also. The two were buried in one grave,
on which a rose and vine were planted,
which grew up and so intermingled their

sell a cow, which he parted with to a
butcher for a few beans. His mother, in
her rage, threw the beans away; but one
of them grew during the night as high
as the heavens. Jack climbed the stalk,
and, by the direction of a fairy, came
to a giant’s castle, where he begged food
and rest. This he did thrice, and in his
three visits stole the giant’s red hen which
laid golden eggs, his money-bags, and his
harp. As he ran off with the last treasure,
the harp cried out, “Master! master!”
which woke the giant, who ran after Jack;

with an axe, and the giant was killed in
his fall.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Jack the Giant-Killer</b>, a series of
nursery tales to show the mastery of skill
and wit over brute strength. Jack encounters
various giants, but outwits them
all. The following would illustrate the
sort of combat: Suppose they came to a
thick iron door, the giant would belabor
it with his club hour after hour without
effect; but Jack would apply a delicate
key, and the door would open at once.
This is not one of the stories, but will
serve to illustrate the sundry contests.
Jack was a “valiant Cornishman,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>his first exploit was to kill the giant Cormoran,
by digging a deep pit, which he
filmed over with grass, etc. The giant fell
into the pit, and Jack knocked him on the
head with a hatchet. Jack afterwards obtained
a coat of invisibility, a cap of
knowledge, a resistless sword, and shoes of
swiftness; and, thus armed, he almost rid
Wales of its giants.</p>

The name Jean is often used in

A kind and generous man by nature, was
Dr. Jeddler, and though he had taught
himself the art of turning good to dross,
and sunshine into shade, he had not
taught himself to forget his warm benevolence
and active love. He wore a pigtail,

<p class='c020'><b>Jeph´thah’s Daughter.</b> When Jephthah
went forth against the Ammonites, he
vowed that if he returned victorious he
would sacrifice, as a burnt offering, whatever
first met him on his entrance into his
native city. He gained a splendid victory,
and at the news thereof his only daughter
came forth dancing to give him welcome.
The miserable father rent his clothes in
agony, but the noble-spirited maiden would
not hear of his violating his vow. She demanded
a short respite, to bewail upon
the mountains her blighted hope of becoming
a mother, and then submitted to
her fate.—<cite>Judges</cite>, xi.</p>

<p class='c001'>An almost identical tale is told of Idomeneus,
king of Crete. On his return from
the Trojan war, he made a vow in a tempest
that, if he escaped, he would offer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Neptune the first living creature that presented
itself to his eye on the Cretan shore.
His own son was there to welcome him
home, and Idomeneus offered him up a
sacrifice to the sea-god, according to his
vow. Fénelon has introduced this legend
in his <cite>Télémaque</cite>, v.</p>

<p class='c001'>Agamemnon vowed to Diana, if he might
be blessed with a child, that he would sacrifice
to her the dearest of all his possessions.
Iphigenīa, his infant daughter, was,
of course, his “dearest possession;” but he
refused to sacrifice her, and thus incurred
the wrath of the goddess, which resulted
in the detention of the Trojan fleet at Aulis.
Iphigenia being offered in sacrifice,
the offended deity was satisfied, and interposed
at the critical moment, by carrying
the princess to Tauris and substituting a
stag in her stead.</p>

<p class='c001'>The latter part of this tale cannot fail to
call to mind the offering of Abraham. As
he was about to take the life of Isaac,
Jehovah interposed, and a ram was substituted

for the death of Girnando, whom he had
slain in a duel. Godfrey sends to the enchanted

who continued to appear and disappear

visited all the mythical nations of the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. <i>Of Jewish story</i>. Tradition says that
<span class='sc'>Cartaph´ilos</span>, the door-keeper of the judgment
hall, in the service of Pontius Pilate,
struck our Lord as he led Him forth, saying,
“Get on! Faster, Jesus!” Whereupon
the Man of Sorrows replied “I am
going; but tarry thou till I come [<em>again</em>].”
This man afterwards became a Christian,
and was baptized by Ananias under the
name of Joseph. Every hundred years he
falls into a trance, out of which he rises
again at the age of 30.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ The earliest account of the Wandering
Jew, is in the <em>Book of the Chronicles of
the Abbey of St. Alban’s</em>, copied and continued
by Matthew Paris (1228). In 1242
Philip Mouskes, afterwards bishop of
Tournay, wrote the “rhymed chronicles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another legend is that Jesus, pressed
down by the weight of His cross, stopped
to rest at the door of a cobbler, named
<span class='sc'>Ahasue´rus</span>, who pushed him away, saying,
“Get off! Away with you! away!”
Our Lord replied, “Truly, I go away, and
that quickly; but tarry thou till I come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A third legend says that it was the cobbler
Ahasue´rus who haled Jesus to the
judgment seat; and that, as the Man of
Sorrows stayed to rest awhile on a stone,
he pushed Him, saying, “Get on, Jesus!
Here you shall not stay!” Jesus replied,
“I truly go away, and go to rest; but thou
shalt go away, and never rest till I come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>3. <cite>In German legend</cite>, the Wandering

was in 1774, at Brussels.</p>

manner as to attract the attention of all
Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Dr. Croly, in his novel called <cite>Salathiel</cite>

Jew; so does Eugène Sue, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Le
Juif Errant</cite></span> (1845); but in these novels the
Jew makes no figure of importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>G Doré, in 1861, illustrated the legend

was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered,
easy-going, foolish, dear fellow. A Herculês
in strength, and in weakness also.”
He lived in terror of his wife, but loved
Pip, whom he brought up. His great word

She “was tall and bony, and wore a coarse
apron fastened over her figure behind with
two loops, and having a square bib in front,
stuck full of needles and pins.” She brought
up Pip, but made his home as wretched

“Tickler” ready for immediate use. Mrs.
Joe was a very clean woman, and cleanliness

he divided the land. John was made
sovereign of Teneduc, and was called
<i>Prester</i>, because he converted the natives.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another tradition says he had seventy
kings for his vassals, and was seen by his
subjects only three times a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marco Polo says that Prester John was

take me to ride round the world? (3) What
are my thoughts?” The king gave the
abbot three weeks for his answers. A
shepherd undertook to disguise himself as
the abbot, and to answer the questions.
To the first he said, “The king’s worth is
twenty-nine pence, for the Saviour Himself
was sold for thirty pence, and his
majesty is mayhap a penny worse than
He.” To the second question he answered,
“If you rise with the sun and ride with

to the North Americans generally.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Jones</b> (<i>Tom</i>), the hero of a novel by
Fielding, called <cite>The History of Tom Jones,
a Foundling</cite> (1749). Tom Jones is a model
of generosity, openness, and manly spirit,
mingled with thoughtless dissipation.
With all this, he is not to be admired; his
reputation is flawed, he sponges for a

they were “cat and dog.” Donna Inez
tried to prove him mad, in order to obtain
a divorce, and “kept a journal where all
his faults were noted.” “She witnessed

the libertine to a duel, fell. A statue of
the murdered father was erected in the
family vault; and one day when Don Juan
forced his way into the vault, he invited
the statue to a banquet. The statue accordingly

of John, because Jesus loved him more
than He loved the rest of the apostles;
and this hatred towards the beloved disciple
made him hate the lover of “the
beloved.” Judas also feared (says Klopstock)
that John would have a higher
post than himself in the kingdom, and
perhaps be made treasurer. The poet
tells us that Judas betrayed Jesus under

Many nobles sought her in marriage, but
she refused them all, being resolved to live

near the Severn, which abounded with
serpents, but at her prayer they were all

St. Michael, and by her prayer a spring of
healing waters burst out of the earth, and
whoever drinks first of this water after
marriage will become the dominant house-power.
“Now,” says Southey, “a Cornishman

moment the ring was on ran up to the

investiture of a sword. In English history,
the lord of Man was styled “king;”
so was the lord of the Isle of Wight, and
the lord of Connaught, as clearly appears

<p class='c020'><b>King and the Locusts.</b> A king made
a proclamation that, if any man would tell
him a story which should last forever, he
would make him his heir and son-in-law;
but if anyone undertook to do so and
failed, he should lose his head. After
many failures, came one, and said: “A
certain king seized all the corn of his
kingdom, and stored it in a huge granary;
but a swarm of locusts came, and a
small cranny was descried, through which
one locust could contrive to creep. So
one locust went in, and carried off one
grain of corn; and then another locust
went in, and carried off another grain of
corn; and then another locust went in,”
etc.; and so the man went on, day after
day, and week after week, “and so another
locust went in, and carried off another
grain of corn.” A month passed; a year
passed. In six months more, the king
said, “How much longer will the locusts
be?” “Oh, your majesty,” said the story-teller,
“they have cleared at present only
a cubit, and there are many thousand cubits
in the granary.” “Man, man!” cried
the king; “you will drive me mad. Take
my daughter, take my kingdom, take
everything I have: only let me hear no
more of these intolerable locusts!”—<cite>Letters

resumed the title “king of France” in
1814; and Louis Phillipe again resumed
the more Republican title “king of the
French” (1830).</p>

imitation of Charlemagne. If so, it was a
blunder; Charlemagne was never “<em>king</em> of
Rome,” but he was “patrician of Rome.”
In the German empire, the heir-apparent
was “king of the Romans,” not “king of
Rome.” This latter title was expressly
conferred on the German kings, and sometimes
on their heirs, by a coronation at

“dauphin,” or “prince of Wales,” was
“king of the Romans.”</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Kings of England.</i> Three seems to be
a kind of ruling number in our English
sovereigns. Besides the coincidences
mentioned above, connected with the
number, may be added the following:—(1)
That of the four kings who married
French princesses, three of them suffered
violent deaths, viz., Edward II., Richard
II., and Charles I. (2) The three longest
reigns have been three threes, viz., Henry
III., Edward III., and George III. (3)
We have no instance, as in France, of
three brothers succeeding each other.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Kings of France.</b> The French have
been singularly unfortunate in their
choice of royal surnames, when designed
to express anything except some personal
quality, as <em>handsome</em>, <em>fat</em>, of which we
cannot judge the truth. Thus, Louis
VIII., a very feeble man in mind and
body, was surnamed <em>the Lion</em>; Philippe
II., whose whole conduct was overreaching
and selfish, was <em>the Magnanimous</em>;
Philippe III., the tool of Labrosse,
was <i>the Daring</i>; Philippe VI., the most
unfortunate of all the kings of France,
was surnamed <i>the Lucky</i>; Jean, one of
the worst of all the kings, was called
<i>the Good</i>; Charles VI., an idiot, and
Louis XV., a scandalous debauchee, were
surnamed <i>the Well-beloved</i>; Henri II., a
man of pleasure, wholly under the thumb
of Diane de Poitiers, was called <i>the
War-like</i>; Louis XIII., most unjust in
domestic life, where alone he had any
freedom of action, was called <i>the Just</i>;
Louis XIV., a man of mere ceremony
and posture, who lost battle after battle,
and brought the nation to absolute bankruptcy,
was surnamed <i>the Great King</i>.
(He was little in stature, little in mind,
little in all moral and physical faculties;
and <i>great</i> only in such littlenesses as
posturing, dressing, ceremony and gormandizing).
And Louis XVIII., forced
on the nation by conquerors, quite against
the general will, was called <i>the Desired</i>.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Kings of France.</i> The succession of
three brothers has been singularly fatal
in French monarchism. The Capetian
dynasty terminated with three brothers,
sons of Philippe, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le Bel</i></span> (viz., Louis X.,
Philippe V., and Charles IV.). The
Valois dynasty came to an end by the
succession of the three brothers, sons of
Henri II. (viz., François II., Charles IX.,
and Henri III.). The next or Bourbon
dynasty terminated in the same manner
(Louis XVI., Louis XVIII., and Charles
X.).</p>

<p class='c001'>After Charles IV. (the third brother of
the Capetian dynasty), came Phillipe de
Valois, a collateral descendant; after
Henri III. (the third brother of the Valois
dynasty), came Henry de Bourbon, a collateral
descendant; and after Charles X.
(the third brother of the Bourbon dynasty),
came Louis Philippe, a collateral descendant.

<p class='c020'><b>Kingsale</b> (<i>Lord</i>), allowed to wear his
hat in the presence of royalty. In 1203,
Hugh de Lacie treacherously seized Sir
John de Courcy, lord of Kingsale, and
King John condemned him to perpetual
imprisonment in the Tower. When he
had been there about a year, King John
and Philippie <i>Auguste</i> of France agreed to
determine certain claims by combat. It
was then that John applied to de Courcy
to be his champion; and, as soon as the
giant knight entered the lists, the French
champion ran away panic-struck. John
now asked his champion what reward he
could give him for his service. “Titles
and estates I have enow,” said de Courcy;
and then requested that, after having paid
obeisance, he and his heirs might stand
covered in the presence of the king, and
his successors.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Kingship</b> (<i>Disqualifications for</i>). Any
personal blemish disqualified a person
from being king during the semi-barbarous
stage of society; thus, putting out the
eyes of a prince, to disqualify him from
reigning, was by no means uncommon. It
will be remembered that Hubert designed
to put out the eyes of Prince Arthur with
this object. Witi´za, the Vizigoth, put out
the eyes of Theodofred, “inhabilitandole
pāra la monarchia,” says Ferraras. When
Albuquerque took possession of Ormuz,
he deposed fifteen kings of Portugal, and,
instead of killing them, put out their
eyes.</p>

a religious military order, whose residence
was in the island of Malta. Some time

into the Holy Land, some Neapolitan
merchants built a house for those of their
countrymen who came thither on pilgrimage.
Afterwards they built a church
to St. John, and an hospital for the
sick, whence they took the name of
“Hospitallers.” In 1104 the order became
military, and changed the term “Hospitallers”
into that of “Knights Hospitallers.”
In 1310 they took Rhodes, and
the order was then called “The Knights

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Crescent</b>, a military
order, instituted by Renatus, of Anjou,
king of Sicily, etc., in 1448. So called
from the badge, which is a crescent of gold
enamelled. What gave rise to this institution
was that Renatus took for his device
a crescent, with the word <em>loz</em> (“praise”),
which, in the style of <em>rebus</em>, makes <em>loz in
crescent</em>, <i>i. e.</i> “by advancing in virtue one

the crown of France.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Garter</b>, instituted by
Edward III. of England, in 1344. According
to Selden, “it exceeds in majesty,
honor, and fame, all chivalrous orders in
the world.” The story is that Joan,
countess of Salisbury, while dancing with
the king, let fall her garter, and the gallant
Edward, perceiving a smile on the face of
the courtiers, picked it up, bound it round
his own knee, and exclaimed, “Honi soit

motto of the order are thus accounted
for.</p>

country”).</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Hare</b>, an order of
twelve knights, instituted by Edward III.
while he was in France. The French
raised a tremendous shout, and Edward
thought it was the cry of battle, but it
was occasioned by a hare running between
the two armies. From this incident
the knights created on the field after this
battle were termed “Knights of the Order
of the Hare.”</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Holy Ghost</b> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Chevalier
de l’Ordre du Saint Esprit</i></span>), instituted
by Henri III., of France, on his return from

origin of the order.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Holy Sepulchre</b>, an
order of knighthood founded by St. Hel´ena,
when she visited Jerusalem, at the
age of 80, and found (as it is said) the

in the right hand, and a gold key in the
left. It resembled the “Odd Fellows” of
more modern times.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Porcupine</b> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Chevaliers
de l’Ordre du Porcépic</i></span>), a French order of
knighthood. The original motto was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Cominus

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Red Staff</b>, an order instituted
by Alfonso XI. of Castile and Leon,
in 1330.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Round Table</b>. King
Arthur’s knights were so called, because
they sat with him at a round table made
by Merlin, for King Leodegraunce. This
king gave it to Arthur on his marriage
with Guinever, his daughter. It contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>seats for 150 knights, 100 of which
King Leodegraunce furnished when he

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Swan</b> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Chevalier de
l’Ordre du Cygne</i></span>), an order of knighthood
founded in 1443 by the elector Frederick
II., of Brandenburg, and restored in 1843
by Frederick William IV., of Prussia. Its
object is the relief of distress generally.
The king of Prussia is grand-master. The
motto is <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Gott mit uns</i></span> (“God be with
you”); and the collar is of gold. The
white swan is the badge of the house of
Cleves (Westphalia).</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord Berners has a novel called <cite>The
Knight of the Swan</cite> (sixteenth century).</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Thistle</b>, said to be
founded by Archaicus, king of the Scots,
in 809; revived in 1530 by James V., of
Scotland; again in 1687 by James II., of
Great Britain; and again by Queen Anne,
who placed the order on a permanent footing.
The decoration consists of a collar of
enamelled gold, composed of sixteen thistles
interlaced with sprigs of rue, and
a small golden image of St. Andrew within
a circle. The motto is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nemo me impune
lacessit</i></span>. The members are sometimes
called “Knights of St Andrew.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>rue</em> mixed with the thistles is a pun
on the word “Andrew” <em>thistles And-rue</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ There was at one time a French
“Order of the Thistle” in the house of
Bourbon, with the same decoration and
motto.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Knights of the Virgin’s Looking-Glass</b>,
an order instituted in 1411 by Ferdinand

<p class='c020'><b>Knights Teutonic</b>, originally called
“Knights of St. George,” then “Knights
of the Virgin Mary,” and lastly “Teutonic
Knights of the Hospital of St. Mary the
Virgin.” This order was instituted by
Henry, king of Jerusalem, in compliment
to the German volunteers who accompanied
Frederick Barbarossa on his crusade.
The knights were soon afterwards
placed under the tutelage of the Virgin,
to whom a hospital had been dedicated
for the relief of German Pilgrims; and in
1191, Pope Celestine III. confirmed the
privileges, and changed the name of the
order into the “Teutonic Knights,” etc.
Abolished by Napoleon in 1809.</p>

diamond once called “The Great Mogul.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Held in the fourteenth century by the
rajah of Malwa. Later it fell into the hands
of the sultans of Delhi, after their conquest
of Malwa. It belonged in the seventeenth
century, to Aurungzebe the Great. The
Schah Jihan sent it to Hortensio Borgio
to be cut, but the Venetian lapidary re-reduced
it from 793-5/8 carats to 186, and
left it dull and lustreless. It next passed
into the hands of Aurungzebe’s great-grandson,
who hid it in his turban. Nadir Schah
invited the possessor to a feast, and insisted
on changing turbans, “to cement
their love,” and thus it fell into Nadir’s
hands, who gave it the name of “Koh-i-noor.”
It next passed into the hands of
Ahmed Shah, founder of the Cabûl
dynasty; was extorted from Shah Shuja
by Runjet Singh, who wore it set in a
bracelet. After the murder of Shu Singh,
it was deposited in the Lahore treasury,
and after the annexation of the Punjaub,
was presented to Queen Victoria, in
1850. It has been recut, and, though reduced
to 106 carats, is supposed to be
worth £140,000.</p>

bag, which he fastened with packthread,
and hung round the neck of Kolao, telling
him to lay the body in a new hut, put the
bag near the mouth, and so let the soul
return to it, but on no account to open the
bag before everything was ready. Kolao
placed the bag in his wife’s hands while he
built the hut, strictly enjoining her not to
open it; but curiosity led her to open the
bag, and out flew the soul to the country
of Pat-Koot-Parout again.—T. S. Gueulette,

the handles, and the arm and hand went
under the lake again (pt. i. 23).</p>

the head of Sir Balin, because he
had slain her brother; but the king refused

his father: “Lo! yonder is a beast of prey;
shoot thine arrow in that direction.” Lamech
did as his son had spoken, and the arrow struck
Cain, who was walking afar off, and killed him....
Now when Lamech ... saw [<i>sic</i>] that he had

<p class='c020'><b>La Roche</b>, a Swiss pastor, travelling
through France with his daughter Margaret,
was taken ill, and like to die. There
was only a wayside inn in the place, but
Hume, the philosopher, heard of the circumstance,
and removed the sick man to
his own house. Here, with good nursing, La
Roche recovered, and a strong friendship
sprang up between the two. Hume even
accompanied La Roche to his manse in
Berne. After the lapse of three years,
Hume was informed that Mademoiselle
was about to be married to a young Swiss
officer, and hastened to Berne to be present
at the wedding. On reaching the neighborhood,
he observed some men filling up
a grave, and found on inquiry that Mademoiselle
had just died of a broken heart.
In fact, her lover had been shot in a duel,
and the shock was too much for her. The
old pastor bore up heroically, and Hume
admired the faith which could sustain a
man in such an affliction.—H. Mackenzie,

<p class='c020'><b>Launcelot</b>, bard to the Countess Brenhilda’s
father.—Sir W. Scott, <cite>Count Robert
of Paris</cite> (time, Rufus).</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Launcelot</i> (<i>Sir</i>), originally called Galahad,
was the son of Ban, king of Benwick
(<i>Brittany</i>), and his wife, Elein (pt. i. 60).
He was stolen in infancy by Vivienne, the
Lady of the Lake, who brought him up
till he was presented to King Arthur and
knighted. In consequence, he is usually
called Sir Launcelot du Lac. He was in
“the eighth degree [<i>or generation</i>] of our
Saviour” (pt. iii. 35); was uncle to Sir
Bors de Ganis (pt. iii. 4); his brother was
Sir Ector de Maris (pt. ii. 127); and his
son, by Elaine, daughter of King Pelles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>was Sir Galahad, the chastest of the 150
knights of the Round Table, and therefore
allotted to the “Siege Perilous” and the
quest of the Holy Graal, which he achieved.
Sir Launcelot had from time to time a
glimpse of the Holy Graal; but in consequence
of his amours with Queen Guenever,
was never allowed more than a
distant and fleeting glance at it (pt. iii. 18,
22, 45).</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Launcelot was the strongest and
bravest of the 150 knights of the Round
Table; the two next were Sir Tristram and
Sir Lamoracke. His adultery with Queen
Guenever was directly or indirectly the
cause of the death of King Arthur, the
breaking up of the Round Table, and the
death of most of the knights. The tale
runs thus: Mordred and Agravain hated
Sir Launcelot, told the king he was too
familiar with the queen, and, in order to
make good their charge, persuaded Arthur
to go a-hunting. While absent in the
chase, the queen sent for Sir Launcelot
to her private chamber, when Mordred,
Agravain, and twelve other knights beset
the door, and commanded him to come
forth. In coming forth he slew Sir Agravain
and the twelve knights; but Mordred
escaped and told the king, who condemned
Guenever to be burned to death. She was
brought to the stake, but rescued by Sir
Launcelot, who carried her off to Joyous
Guard, near Carlisle. The king besieged
the castle, but received a bull from the
pope, commanding him to take back the
queen. This he did, but refused to be
reconciled to Sir Launcelot, who accordingly
left the realm and went to Benwick.
Arthur crossed over with an army to besiege
Benwick, leaving Mordred regent.
The traitor, Mordred, usurped the crown,
and tried to make the queen marry him;
but she rejected his proposal with contempt.
When Arthur heard thereof, he returned,
and fought three battles with his nephew,
in the last of which Mordred was slain,
and the king received from his nephew his
death-wound. The queen now retired to
the convent of Almesbury, where she was
visited by Sir Launcelot; but as she refused
to leave the convent, Sir Launcelot
turned monk, died “in the odor of sanctity,”
and was buried in Joyous Guard
(pt. iii. 143-175).</p>

<p class='c021'>“Ah! Sir Launcelot,” said Sir Ector; “thou
were [<i>sic</i>] head of all Christian knights.” “I
dare say,” said Sir Bors, “that Sir Launcelot
there thou liest, thou were never matched of
none earthly knight’s hand; and thou were the
courteoust knight that ever bare shield; and
thou were the truest friend to thy lover that ever
bestrode horse; and thou were the truest lover
of sinfull man that ever loved woman; and
thou were the kindest man that ever struck with
sword; and thou were the goodliest person that
ever came among press of knights; and thou
were the meekest man and the gentlest that ever
eat in hall among ladies; and thou were the
sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put
spear in rest.”—Sir T. Malory, <cite>History of Prince
Arthur</cite>, iii. 176 (1470).</p>

<p class='c020'>N. B.—The Elaine above referred to is
not the Elaine of Astolat, the heroine of
Tennyson’s <cite>Idyll</cite>. Sir Ector de Maris is
not Sir Ector, the foster-father of King
Arthur; and Sir Bors de Ganis must be
kept distinct from Sir Bors of Gaul, and
also from Sir Borre or Sir Bors, a natural
son of King Arthur, by Lyonors, daughter
of the Earl Sanam (pt. i. 15).</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Sir Launcelot and Elaine.</i> The Elaine
of Tennyson’s <cite>Idyll</cite>, called the “fair maid
of Astolat,” was the daughter of Sir Bernard,
lord of Astolat, and her two brothers
were Sir Tirre (not <i>Sir Torre</i>, as Tennyson
writes the word) and Lavaine (pt. iii. 122).
The whole tale and the beautiful picture
of Elaine propelled by the old dumb servitor
down the river to the king’s palace,
is all borrowed from Sir T. Malory’s compilation.
“The fair maid of Astolat”
asked Sir Launcelot to marry her, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>knight replied, “Fair damsel, I thank you,
but certainly cast me never to be married;”
and when the maid asked if she might be
ever with him without being wed, he made
answer, “Mercy defend me, no!” “Then,”
said Elaine, “I needs must die for love of
you;” and when Sir Launcelot quitted
Astolat, she drooped and died. But before
she died she called her brother, Sir Tirre
(not <i>Sir Lavaine</i>, as Tennyson says, because
Sir Lavaine went with Sir Launcelot
as his squire), and dictated the letter that
her brother was to write, and spake thus:</p>

<p class='c021'>“While my body is whole, let this letter be
put into my right hand, and my hand bound
fast with the letter until that I be cold, and let
me be put in a fair bed, with all my richest
clothes.... and be laid in a chariot to the next
place, whereas the Thames is, and there let me
be put in a barge, and but one man with me ...
to steer me thither, and that my barge be covered
with black samite.”... So her father granted ...
that all this should be done ... and she died.
And so, when she was dead, the corpse and the
bed ... were put in a barge ... and the man
steered the barge to Westminster.—Pt. iii. 123.</p>

<p class='c020'>The narrative then goes on to say that
King Arthur had the letter read, and commanded
the corpse to be buried right
royally, and all the knights then present
made offerings over her grave. Not only
the tale, but much of the antique flavor of
the original is preserved in the version of
the laureate.—Sir T. Malory, <cite>History of
Prince Arthur</cite> (1470).</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Launcelot and Guenever.</i> Sir Launcelot
was chosen by King Arthur to conduct
Guenever (his bride) to court; and then
began that disloyalty between them which
lasted to the end. Gottfried, the German
minnesinger (twelfth century), who wrote
the tale of Sir Tristan [our <i>Tristram</i>],
makes King Mark send Tristan to Ireland,
to conduct Yseult to Cornwall, and then
commenced that disloyalty between Sir
Tristram and his uncle’s wife, which also
lasted to the end, and was the death of both.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Launcelot Mad.</i> Sir Launcelot, having
offended the queen, was so vexed, that he
went mad for two years, half raving and
half melancholy. Being partly cured by a
vision of the Holy Graal, he settled for a
time in Joyous Isle, under the assumed
name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La Chevalier Mal-Fet</em></span>. His deeds
of prowess soon got blazed abroad, and
brought about him certain knights of the
Round Table, who prevailed on him to return
to court. Then followed the famous
quest of the Holy Graal. The quest of the
graal is the subject of a minnesong by
Wolfram (thirteenth century), entitled <cite>Parzival</cite>.
(In the <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>,
complied by Sir T. Malory, it is Galahad,
son of Sir Launcelot, not Percival, who
accomplished the quest).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ The madness of Orlando, by Ariosto,
resembles that of Sir Launcelot.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Launcelot a Monk.</i> When Sir Launcelot
discovered that Guenever was resolved to
remain a nun, he himself retired to a monastery,
and was consecrated a hermit by
the bishop of Canterbury. After twelve
months, he was miraculously summoned
to Almesbury, to remove to Glastonbury
the queen, who was at the point of death.
Guenever died half an hour before Sir
Launcelot arrived, and he himself died
soon afterwards (pt. iii. 174). The bishop
in attendance on the dying knight affirmed
that “he saw angels heave Sir Launcelot
up to heaven, and the gates of paradise
open to receive him” (pt. iii. 175). Sir
Bors, his nephew, discovered the dead
body in the cell, and had it buried with all
honors at Joyous Guard (pt. iii. 175).—Sir
T. Malory, <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite> (1470),
and also Walter Mapes.</p>

<p class='c021'>When Sir Bors and his fellows came to his
(Sir Launcelot’s) bed, they found him stark
dead, and he lay as he had smiled, and the
sweetest savor about him that ever they smelled.—Sir
T. Malory, <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>, iii. 175
(1470).</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>N.B.—Sir Launcelot intended, when he
quitted the court of Arthur, and retired to
Benwick, to found religious houses every
ten miles between Sandwich and Carlisle,
and to visit every one of them barefoot;
but King Arthur made war upon him, and
put an end to this intention.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ <i>Other particulars of Sir Launcelot.</i>
The tale of Sir Launcelot was first composed
in monkish Latin, and was translated
by Walter Mapes (about 1180).
Robert de Borron wrote a French version,
and Sir T. Malory took his <cite>History of
Prince Arthur</cite> from the French, the third

<p class='c020'><b>Launfal</b> (<i>Sir</i>), steward of King Arthur.
Detesting Queen Gwennere, he retired to
Carlyoun, and fell in love with a lady
named Tryamour. She gave him an unfailing
purse, and told him if he ever
wished to see her, all he had to do was to
retire into a private room, and she would
be instantly with him. Sir Launfal now
returned to court, and excited much attention
by his great wealth. Gwennere
made advances to him, but he told her she
was not worthy to kiss the feet of the lady
to whom he was devoted. At this repulse,
the angry queen complained to the king,
and declared to him that she had been
most grossly insulted by his steward.
Arthur bade Sir Launfal produce this
paragon of woman. On her arrival, Sir
Launfal was allowed to accompany her to

She admires her husband’s turban, and
dreads his new religion. “Are you really,

whose wife, Hermegild, became
much attached to her. A young
knight wished to marry Custance, but
she declined his suit; whereupon he murdered
Hermegild, and then laid the knife
beside Custance, to make it appear that
she had committed the deed. King Alla,
who tried the case, soon discovered the
truth, executed the knight, and married
Custance. Now was repeated the same
infamy as occurred to her in Syria; the
queen-mother, Donegild, disapproved of
the match, and, during the absence of her
son in Scotland, embarked Custance and
her infant son in the same ship, which
she turned adrift. After floating about
for five years, it was taken in tow by the
Roman fleet on its return from Syria,
and Custance was put under the charge
of a Roman senator. It so happened that
Alla was at Rome at the very time on a

when four score years old, wishing to retire
from the active duties of sovereignty,
resolved to divide his kingdom between
them in proportion to their love. The two
elder said they loved him more than their
tongue could express, but Cordelia, the
youngest, said she loved him as it became
a daughter to love her father. The old
king, displeased with her answer, disinherited
Cordelia, and divided his kingdom
between the other two, with the condition
that each alternately, month by month,
should give him a home, with a suite of
a hundred knights. He spent the first
month with his eldest daughter, who
showed him scant hospitality. Then going
to the second, she refused to entertain so
large a suite; whereupon the old man
would not enter her house, but spent the
night abroad in a storm. When Cordelia,
who had married the king of France,
heard of this, she brought an army over
to dethrone her sisters, but was taken
prisoner and died in jail. In the meantime

She selected Leon because he was supposed
to be a milksop whom she could
bend to her will; but no sooner is she
married than Leon acts with manly firmness
and determination, but with great

was entrapped by brigands, and kept

fell in love with her, and obtained her
guardian’s consent to their union; but
Mariana refused to comply. The case
was referred to the duke (Ferrardo), who
gave judgment in favor of the count.
Leonardo happened to be present, and
throwing off his disguise, assumed his

the jailer’s daughter, fell in love with her.
Pizzaro, the governor of the prison resolving

viewed it with disdain.” Leonora never
married, but lived with her eldest sister,
Lauretta, duchess of Urbino, who was

<p class='c020'><b>Liar</b> (<i>The</i>), a farce by Samuel Foote
(1761). John Wilding, a young gentleman
fresh from Oxford, has an extraordinary
propensity for romancing. He invents
the most marvellous tales, utterly
regardless of truth, and thereby involves
both himself and others in endless perplexities.
He pretends to fall in love with
a Miss Grantam, whom he accidentally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>meets, and, wishing to know her name, is
told it is Godfrey, and that she is an
heiress. Now it so happens that his father
wants him to marry the real Miss Grantam,
and, in order to avoid so doing, he
says he is already married to a Miss Sibthorpe.
He afterwards tells his father he
invented this tale because he really wished
to marry Miss Godfrey. When Miss Godfrey
is introduced, he does not know her,
and while in this perplexity a woman enters,
who declares she is his wife, and that
her maiden name was Sibthorpe. Again
he is dumbfounded, declares he never saw
her in his life, and rushes out, exclaiming,
“All the world is gone mad, and is in
league against me!”</p>

England (<em>the lion</em>) waited on truth
or the reformation. “Sansloy” means
Queen Mary or false faith, which killed
the lion, or separated England from truth
(or the true faith). It might seem to some
that Sansfoy should have been substituted

that some knight would undertake to deliver
her from her oppressor; but as she
refused to give up the name of the lady,
the king said no Knight of the Round
Table could undertake the quest. On this,
a stranger, nicknamed “Beaumains,” from
the size and beauty of his hands, and who
had served in the kitchen for twelve
months, begged to be sent, and his request
was granted. He was very scornfully
treated by Linet; but succeeded in overthrowing
every knight who opposed him,

the <cite>Blun´decral</cite>; “All true believers
break their eggs at the convenient end.”
The god-father of Calin Deffar Plune, the
reigning emperor of Lilliput, happened to
cut his finger while breaking his egg at
the <em>big</em> end, and therefore commanded all
faithful Lilliputians to break their eggs in
future at the <em>small</em> end. The Blefuscudians
called this decree rank heresy, and
determined to exterminate the believers of
such an abominable practice from the
face of the earth. Hundreds of treatises
were published on both sides, but each
empire put all those books opposed to its
own views into the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Index Expurgatorius</cite></span>,
and not a few of the more zealous sort
died as martyrs for daring to follow their
private judgement in the matter.—Swift,

found some nodding columbines and some
blue violets, and made a pretty nosegay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Wolf waited till he saw Little Red

brought you a cake, and a bottle of

<p class='c001'>“Welcome, dear child!” said the grandmother.
“Pull the bobbin, and the latch

<p class='c001'>Then Mr. Wolf pulled the bobbin, and
up flew the latch, and in he went; and
there lay the grandmother in the bed, for

looked at her grandmother, and said:

<cite>British History</cite>, viii. 21; ix. 9,
10 (1142).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ This account differs so widely from
that of Arthurian romance, that it is not
possible to reconcile them. In the <cite>History
of Prince Arthur</cite>, Lot, king of Orkney,
marries Margawse, the “sister of King
Arthur” (pt. i. 2). Tennyson, in his
<cite>Gareth and Lynette</cite>, says that Lot’s wife
was Bellicent. Again, the sons of Lot are
called, in the <cite>History</cite>, Gaw´ain, Agravain,
Ga´heris, and Gareth; Mordred is their
half-brother, being the son of King
Arthur and the same mother.—Sir T.
Malory, <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>, i. 2, 35,
36 (1470).</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Lot</i>, king of Orkney. According to the
<cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite>, King Lot’s wife was Margawse
or Morgawse, sister of King Arthur,
and their sons were Sir Gaw´ain, Sir Ag´ravain,
Sir Ga´heris, and Sir Gareth.—Sir
T. Malory, <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>, i. 36
(1470).</p>

<p class='c001'>Once or twice Elain is called the wife
of Lot, but this is a mistake. Elain was
Arthur’s sister, by the same mother, and
was the wife of Sir Nentres, of Carlot.
Mordred was the son of Morgawse, by her
brother Arthur, and consequently Gawain,
Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth were his
half-brothers.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Lot</i>, king of Orkney. According to
Tennyson, King Lot’s wife was Bellicent,
daughter of Gorloïs, lord of Tintag´il Castle,
in Cornwall, and Lot was the father of
Gaw´ain (2 <i>syl.</i>) and Modred. This account
differs entirely from the <cite>History of
Prince Arthur</cite>, by Sir T. Malory. There
the wife of Lot is called Margawse or Morgawse
(Arthur’s sister). Geoffrey of Monmouth,
on the other hand, calls her Anne
(Arthur’s sister). The sons of Lot, according
to the <cite>History</cite>, were Gawain, Agravain,
Gaheris, and Gareth; Modred or
Mordred being the offspring of Morgawse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and Arthur. This ignoble birth the <cite>History</cite>
assigns as the reason of Mordred’s
hatred to King Arthur, his adulterous
father and uncle. Lot was subdued by
King Arthur, fighting on behalf of Leodogran
or Leodogrance, king of Cam´eliard.—See
Tennyson, <cite>Coming of Arthur</cite>.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Lot’s Wife</b>, Wâhela, who was confederate
with the men of Sodom, and gave

lodge in the house. Her sign was smoke

turned into a pillar of salt.—Jallâlo´ddin,
<cite>Al Zamakh</cite>.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Lothair</b>. Young English gentleman,
the hero of the once-famous political novel
of the same name, by Benjamin Disraeli
(<i>Lord Beaconsfield</i>). The action
of the story turns chiefly upon the vacillation
of Lothair between the claims of
the Roman Catholic and of the English
Church. He decides to unite himself with
the latter.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Lotha´rio</b>, a noble cavalier of Florence,
the friend of Anselmo. Anselmo induced
him to put the fidelity of his wife, Camilla,
to the test, that he might rejoice in her
incorruptible virtue; but Camilla was not
trial-proof, and eloped with Lothario.
Anselmo then died of grief, Lothario was
slain in battle, and Camilla died in a convent.—Cervantes,
<cite>Don Quixote</cite>, I. iv. 5, 6
(“Fatal Curiosity,” 1605).</p>

He seduced Calista, daughter of Sciol´to

This is the “gay Lothario,” which has become

Llew, second son of Arthur; also called
Lotus and Lothus. Arthur’s eldest son
was Urian, and his youngest Arawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ In some legends, Lothian is made

of the rebellious army which fought at
Camlan, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 537, in which Arthur received
his death-wound; but in Malory’s collection,
called <cite>The History of Prince Arthur</cite>, Modred

<p class='c020'><b>Lotte</b> (2 <i>syl.</i>), a young woman of strong
affections and domestic winning ways, the
wife of Albert, a young German farmer.
Werther loved Lotte when she was only
betrothed to Albert, and continued to love
her after she became a young wife. His
mewling and puling after this “forbidden
fruit,” which terminates in suicide, make
up the sum and substance of the tale,
which is told in the form of letters addressed
to divers persons.—Goethe, <cite>Sorrows
of Werther</cite> (1774).</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lotte” was Charlotte Buff, who married
Kestner, Goethe’s friend, the “Albert”
of the novel. Goethe was in love with
Charlotte Buff, and her marriage with
Kestner soured the temper of his over-sensitive
mind.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Lotus-Eaters</b> or <i>Lotoph´agi</i>, a people
who ate of the lotus tree, the effect of which
was to make them forget their friends and
homes, and to lose all desire of returning
to their native land. The lotus-eater
only cares to live in ease, luxury, and idleness.—Homer,
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, xi.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>⁂ Tennyson has a poem called <cite>The

and an Irishman in the Prussian army.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>It is given out that Charlotte has lost her

(1) Waller loves Lydia, lady’s maid
to Widow Green, but in reality the sister
of Trueworth. She quitted home to avoid
a hateful marriage, and took service for
the nonce with Widow Green. (2) Wildrake
loves Constance, daughter of Sir
William Fondlove. (3) Sir William Fondlove,
aged 60, loves Widow Green, aged
40. The difficulties to be overcome were
these: The social position of Lydia galled
the aristocratic pride of Waller, but love
won the day. Wildrake and Constance
sparred with each other, and hardly knew
they loved till it dawned upon them that
each might prefer some other, and then
they felt that the loss would be irreparable.
Widow Green set her heart on marrying
Waller; but as Waller preferred Lydia,
she accepted Sir William for better or
worse.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Love Doctor</b> (<i>The</i>), <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Amour Médecin</cite></span>,
a comedy by Molière (1665). Lucinde,
the daughter of Sganarelle, is in love, and
the father calls in four doctors to consult
upon the nature of her malady. They see
the patient, and retire to consult together,
but talk about Paris, about their visits,
about the topics of the day; and when the
father enters to know what opinion they
have formed, they all prescribe different
remedies, and pronounce different opinions.
Lisette then calls in a “quack”
doctor (Clitandre, the lover), who says
that he must act on the imagination, and
proposes a seeming marriage, to which
Sganarelle assents, saying, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Voila un

<p class='c020'><b>Love in a Village</b>, an opera by Isaac
Bickerstaff. It contains two plots: the
loves of Rosetta and young Meadows, and
the loves of Lucinda and Jack Eustace.
The entanglement is this: Rosetta’s father
wanted her to marry young Meadows, and
Sir William Meadows wanted his son to
marry Rosetta; but as the young people
had never seen each other, they turned
restive and ran away. It so happened
that both took service with Justice Woodcock—Rosetta
as chamber-maid, and
Meadows as gardener. Here they fell in
love with each other, and ultimately married,
to the delight of all concerned. The
other part of the plot is this:</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucinda was the daughter of Justice
Woodcock, and fell in love with Jack Eustace
while nursing her sick mother, who
died. The justice had never seen the
young man, but resolutely forbade the
connection; whereupon Jack Eustace entered
the house as a music-master, and, by
the kind offices of friends, all came right
at last.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Love Makes a Man</b>, a comedy concocted
by Colley Cibber, by welding together
two of the comedies of Beaumont
and Fletcher, viz., the <cite>Elder Brother</cite> and
the <cite>Custom of the Country</cite>. Carlos, a
young student (son of Antonio), sees Angelina,
the daughter of Charino, and falls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>in love with her. His character instantly
changes, and the modest, diffident bookworm
becomes energetic, manly, and resolute.
Angelina is promised by her father
to Clodio, a coxcomb, the younger brother
of Carlos; but the student elopes with her.
They are taken captives, but meet after
several adventures, and become duly engaged.
Clodio, who goes in search of the
fugitives, meets with Elvira, to whom he
engages himself, and thus leaves the field
open to his brother Carlos.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Love’s Labor’s Lost.</b> Ferdinand, king
of Navarre, with three lords named Biron,
Dumain, and Longaville, agreed to spend
three years in study, during which time
no woman was to approach the court.
Scarcely had they signed the compact,
when the princess of France, attended by
Rosaline, Maria, and Katharine, besought
an interview respecting certain debts said
to be due from the king of France to the
king of Navarre. The four gentlemen fell
in love with the four ladies: the king with
the princess, Biron with Rosaline, Longaville
with Maria, and Dumain with Katharine.
In order to carry their suits, the
four gentlemen, disguised as Muscovites,
presented themselves before the ladies;
but the ladies, being warned of the masquerade,
disguised themselves also, so that
the gentlemen in every case addressed the
wrong lady. However, it was at length
arranged that the suits should be deferred
for twelve months and a day; and if, at
the expiration of that time, they remained
of the same mind, the matter should be
taken into serious consideration.—Shakespeare,
<cite>Love’s Labor’s Lost</cite> (1594).</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Loves of the Angels</b>, the stories of
three angels, in verse, by T. Moore (1822).
The stories are founded on the Eastern
tale of <cite>Harût and Marût</cite>, and the rabbinical
fictions of the loves of <cite>Uzziel and
Shamchazai.</cite></p>

<p class='c001'>1. The first angel fell in love with Lea,
whom he saw bathing. She returned love
for love, but his love was carnal, her’s
heavenly. He loved the woman, she loved
the angel. One day, the angel told her
the spell-word which opens the gates of
heaven. She pronounced it, and rose
through the air into paradise, while the
angel became imbruted, being no longer
an angel of light, but “of the earth,
earthy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>2. The second angel was Rubi, one of
the seraphs. He fell in love with Liris,
who asked him to come in all his celestial
glory. He did so; and she, rushing into
his arms, was burnt to death; but the kiss
she gave him became a brand on his face
for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. The third angel was Zaraph, who
loved Nama. It was Nama’s desire to
love without control, and to love holily:
but as she had fixed her love on a creature,
and not on the Creator, both she and
Zaraph were doomed to live among the
things that perish, till this mortal is swallowed
up of immortality, when Nama and
Zaraph will be admitted into the realms
of everlasting love.</p>

skeleton of the maiden revealed the mystery
of her disappearance.—T. H. Bayley,
<cite>The Mistletoe Bough</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Rogers has introduced this story
in his <cite>Italy</cite> (pt. i. 18, 1822). He says the
bride was Ginevra, only child of Orsini,
“an indulgent father;” and that the
bridegroom was Francesco Doria, “her
playmate from birth, and her first love.”
The chest, he says, was an heirloom,
“richly carved by Antony, of Trent, with
Scripture stories from the life of Christ.”
It came from Venice, and had “held the
ducal robes of some old ancestors.” After
the accident, Francesco, weary of life, flew
to Venice, and “flung his life away in
battle with the Turks;” Orsini went deranged,
and spent the life-long day “wandering
in quest of something he could
not find.” It was fifty years afterwards
that the skeleton was discovered in the
chest.</p>

a son, Frederick, who in due time became
a soldier. While on furlough, he came to
spend his time with his mother, and found
her reduced to abject poverty, and almost
starved to death. A poor cottager took
her in, while Frederick, who had no
money, went to beg charity. Count Wildenhaim
was out with his gun, and Frederick
asked alms of him. The count gave
him a shilling; Frederick demanded more,
and being refused, seized the baron by the
throat. The keepers soon came up, collared
him, and put him in the castle dungeon.
Here he was visited by the chaplain,
and it came out that the count was
his father. The chaplain being appealed
to, told the count the only reparation he
could make would be to marry Agatha,
and acknowledge the young soldier to be
his son. The advice he followed, and Agatha
Friburg, the beggar, became the Baroness
Wildenhaim, of Wildenhaim Castle.</p>

sister, Lynette, went to King Arthur, to
crave that Sir Lancelot might be sent to
deliver Lyonors from her oppressor. The
king gave the quest to Gareth, who was
knighted, and accompanied Lynette, who
used him very scornfully at first; but at
every victory which he gained she abated
somewhat of her contempt; and married
him after he had succeeded in delivering
Lyonors. The lot of Lyonors is not told.

was quite another person. She was daughter
of Earl Sanam, and mother of Sir

Lionês who was the sister of Linet, and
whose father was Sir Persaunt, of Castle
Perilous (pt. i. 153). The <cite>History</cite> says

Hermia fled from Athens with Lysander.
Demetrius went in pursuit, and was followed

aversion to Macaire, that suspicion was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>aroused, and the man and dog were pitted
to single combat. The result was fatal
to the man, who died confessing his guilt.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two French plays on the subject,

took place near this castle, and was depicted
in the great hall over the chimney-piece.</p>

and grandson of Malcolm II., by his second
daughter; the elder daughter married
Crynin, father of Duncan, who succeded
his grandfather on the throne. Hence,
King Duncan and Macbeth were cousins.
Duncan, staying as a guest with Macbeth,
at the Castle of Inverness (1040), was
murdered by his host, who then usurped
the crown. The battle which Macbeth
had just won was this: Sueno, king of
Norway, had landed with an army in Fife
for the purpose of invading Scotland;
Macbeth and Banquo were sent against
him, and defeated him with such loss
that only ten men of all his army escaped
alive. Macbeth was promised by the
witches (1) that none of woman born
should kill him, and (2) that he should
not die till Burham Wood removed to
Dunsinane. He was slain in battle by
Macduff, who was “from his mother’s
womb untimely ripped;” and as for the
moving wood, the soldiers of Macduff, in
their march to Dunsinane, were commanded
to carry boughs of the forest before
them to conceal their numbers.</p>

witches prophesied he should be king, she
induced him to murder Duncan, who was
at the time their guest. She would herself
have done it, but he looked in sleep
so like her father that she could not.
However, when Macbeth had murdered
the king, she felt no scruple in murdering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the two grooms that slept with him, and
throwing the guilt on them. After her
husband was crowned, she was greatly
troubled by dreams, and used to walk in
her sleep, trying to rub from her hands
imaginary stains of blood. She died,
probably by her own hand.—Shakespeare,

C. Dibdin, “that though ‘Lady Macbeth’

Mrs. Siddons calls Mrs. Pritchard “the
greatest of all the ‘Lady Macbeths;’” but
Mrs. Siddons herself was so great in this
character that, in the sleep-walking scene,
in her farewell performance, the whole
audience stood on the benches, and demanded
that the performance should end
with that scene.</p>

not know of his absence, but with a view

of little Dorrit’s nurse. She had had a
fever at the age of ten, from ill-treatment,
and her mind and intellect never went beyond
that period. Thus, if asked her age,
she always replied, “Ten;” and she always
repeated the last two or three words of
what was said to her. She called Amy
Dorritt “Little Mother.”</p>

<p class='c021'>She was about eight and twenty, with large
bones, large features, large feet and hands, large
eyes, and no hair. Her large eyes were limpid
and almost colorless; they seemed to be very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>little affected by light, and to stand unnaturally
still. There was also that attentive listening expression
in her face, which is seen in the faces of
the blind; but she was not blind, having one
tolerably serviceable eye. Her face was not exceedingly
ugly, being redeemed by a smile....
A great white cap, with a quantity of opaque
frilling ... apologized for Maggy’s baldness,
and made it so difficult for her old black bonnet
to retain its place on her head, that it held on
round her neck like a gypsy’s baby.... The

a violent passion, to sigh <i>à propos</i>, to
make an attractive gesture, to trifle agreeably,
and collect the various graces of dumb eloquence
into a smile, were the arts in which she excelled.
She spent hours before her glass in deciding how
a curl might be made to hang loose upon her
neck to the greatest advantage; how to open
and shut her lips so as best to show her teeth
without affectation—to turn her face full or
otherwise, as occasion might require. She looked
on herself with ceaseless admiration, and always
admired most the works of her own hand in
improving on the beauty which nature had bestowed
on her.—T. S. Gueulette, <cite>Chinese Tales</cite>

<p class='c020'><i>Mahomet.</i> Voltaire wrote a drama so
entitled in 1738; and James Miller, in
1740, produced an English version of the
same, called <cite>Mahomet the Impostor</cite>. The
scheme of the play is this: Mahomet is
laying siege to Mecca, and has in his camp
Zaphna and Palmira, taken captives in
childhood and brought up by him. They
are really the children of Alcanor, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>chief of Mecca, but know it not, and love
each other. Mahomet is in love with Palmira,
and sets Zaphna to murder Alcanor,
pretending that it is God’s will. Zaphna
obeys the behest, is told that Alcanor is
his father, and is poisoned. Mahomet
asks Palmira in marriage, and she stabs
herself.</p>

the one corresponds with the life of the
other. The Malbrough of the song was
evidently a crusader or ancient baron, who
died in battle; and his lady, climbing the
castle tower and looking out for her lord,
reminds one of the mother of Sisera, who
“looked out at a window, and cried through
the lattice, ‘Why is his chariot so long in
coming? Why tarry the wheels of his
chariots? ... Have they not sped? Have
they not divided the spoil?’” (<cite>Judges</cite>, v.
28-30). The following are the words of
the song:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Malbrough is gone to the wars. Ah! when
will he return?” “He will come back by Easter,
lady, or at latest by Trinity.” “No, no! Easter
is past, and Trinity is past; but Malbrough has
not returned.” Then did she climb the castle
tower, to look out for his coming. She saw his
page, but he was clad in black. “My page, my
bonnie page,” cried the lady, “what tidings bring
you—what tidings of my lord?” “The news I
bring,” said the page, “is very sad, and will make
you weep. Lay aside your gay attire, lady, your
ornaments of gold and silver, for my lord is dead.
He is dead, lady, and laid in earth. I saw him
borne to his last home by four officers; one carried
his cuirass, one his shield, one his sword,
and the fourth walked beside the bier, but bore
nothing. They laid him in earth. I saw his
spirit rise through the laurels. They planted
his grave with rosemary. The nightingale sang
his dirge. The mourners fell to the earth; and
when they rose up again, they chanted his victories.
Then retired they all to rest.”</p>

I. never mounted his charger for

caught in a shower of rain, and who, to

in the next book (ch. 15), when the
gentlemen at the inn sit in judgment on
it, to decide whether it is really a “helmet

takes him into his smithy, and tells him
to give any order he likes; but Sir Gruyon
declines the invitation. Mammon next
offers to give the knight Philotine to wife;
but Sir Gruyon still declines. Lastly, the
knight is led to Proserpine’s bower, and told
to pluck some of the golden fruit, and to
rest him awhile on the silver stool; but
Sir Gruyon resists the temptation. After

<p class='c001'>⁂ In the ballad called <cite>The King and
the Miller of Mansfield</cite>, the king is Henry
II., and there are several other points of
difference between the ballad and the play.
In the play, Cockle hears a gun fired, and
goes out to look for poachers, when he
lays hold of the king, but, being satisfied
that he is no poacher, he takes him home.
In the ballad, the king out-rides his lords,
gets lost, and, meeting the miller, asks of
him a night’s lodging. When the miller
feels satisfied with the face and bearing of
the stranger, he entertains him right hospitably.
He gives him for supper a venison
pasty, but tells him on no account to
tell the king “that they made free with
his deer.” Another point of difference is
this: In the play, the courtiers are seized
by the under-keepers, and brought to
Cockle’s house; but in the ballad they
track the king and appear before him next
morning. In the play, the king settles on
Sir John Cockle 1000 marks; in the ballad,
£300 a year.—Percy, <cite>Reliques</cite>, III. ii. 20.</p>

<p class='c001'>(Of course, as Dodsley introduced the
“firing of a gun,” he was obliged to bring
down his date to more modern times, and
none of the Henrys between Henry II.

to indulge in such a prank.)</p>

was made to decide by single combat

birth, and is condemned to death. Faust
attempts to save her, and, gaining admission
to her cell, finds her huddled up
on a bed of straw, singing, like Ophelia,
wild snatches of ancient ballads, her
reason faded, and her death at hand.
Faust tries to persuade the mad girl to
flee with him, but in vain. At last the

Owing to a difficulty in sending prisoners
to New South Wales, she is confined in

<p class='c001'>The reason seems to be this: Ravaillac,

his deed of blood by reading the celebrated
treatise <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Rege et Regio Institutione</cite></span>, by
Mariana the Jesuit, published 1599 (about

Ravaillac “to deliver France from

goat-herds. The crazy knight insisted
that the tavern was a castle, and that
Maritornes, “the lord’s daughter,” was in
love with him.</p>

<p class='c021'>She was broad-faced, flat-nosed, blind of one
eye, and had a most delightful squint with the
other; the peculiar gentility of her shape, however,
compensated for every defect, she being
about three feet in height, and remarkably
hunchbacked.—Cervantes, <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, I. iii. 2

<p class='c020'><b>Mark</b> (<i>Sir</i>), king of Cornwall, who
held his court at Tintag´il. He was a
wily, treacherous coward, hated and despised
by all true knights. One day,
Sir Dinadan, in jest, told him that Sir
Launcelot might be recognized by “his
shield, which was silver with a black
rim.” This was, in fact, the cognizance
of Sir Mordred; but, to carry out the joke,
Sir Mordred lent it to Dagonet, King
Arthur’s fool. Then, mounting the jester
on a large horse, and placing a huge spear
in his hand, the knights sent him to
offer battle to King Mark. When Dagonet
beheld the coward king, he cried
aloud, “Keep thee, sir knight, for I will
slay thee!” King Mark, thinking it to be
Sir Launcelot, spurred his horse to flight.
The fool gave chase, rating King Mark “as
a wood man [<em>madman</em>].” All the knights
who beheld it roared at the jest, told
King Arthur, and the forest rang with
their laughter. The wife of King Mark
was Isond (Ysolde) <i>the Fair</i> of Ireland,
whose love for Sir Tristram was a public
scandal.—Sir T. Malory, <cite>History of Prince
Arthur</cite>, ii. 96, 97 (1470).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
